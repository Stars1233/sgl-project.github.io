    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations.

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to respond to this user\\'s request. They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty straightforward. Now, the user wants the population data. I remember that population numbers can change over time, so I should check the most recent data available, probably from 2021 since that\\'s when I have the information.\\n\\nI recall that Paris has a population around 2 million people. But let me double-check that to be sure. Wait, no, that doesn\\'t seem right. I think it\\'s actually over 2 million. Maybe 2.2 million? Let me think about other major cities in France. Lyon is about a million, and each of the other capitals like Marseille and Lille are a bit smaller. So Paris being the largest makes sense. \\n\\nBut how exact is this data? I can find exact figures, but sometimes projections can add a range to include future estimates. I think the current population is approximately between 2.16 and 2.37 million for Paris. That gives a good range to include in the JSON.\\n\\nNow, putting this into JSON format. The user specified that they want just this information and population. So I should structure it with a \"name\" field for the capital, \"capital\" for the city, and \"population\" as a number with a range. That seems clear and straightforward.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct to avoid any errors. No commas in the keys, proper quotation marks, and the number format should be a float since it\\'s a range.\\n\\nWait, should I include just the population or also mention that it\\'s an estimate? The user didn\\'t specify, but since it\\'s population data, which can fluctuate, providing a range is safer. So I\\'ll include 2.16 and 2.37 million in the population field.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look like this: { \"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": { \"current\": 2162000, \"projection\": [2162000, 2370000] } }. Hmm, or maybe the user just wants a single number, but I think providing both current and a projected range is better for accuracy.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can present it as a single number with a note, but the user requested JSON, so the former approach is probably better. I\\'ll go with the current population as 2162000 and include the projection as an array to show the possible range.\\n\\nI think that covers the user\\'s request.

I know that Paris is the capital, right? Yeah, that's correct. I've heard that Paris is not only the capital but also a major city in France, known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum.\n",

I remember that major cities in France, like Paris and Lyon, have populations over a million. Maybe Paris is around 2 million? I'm not entirely certain. I should probably double-check that. Wait, I think the population is approximately 2.1 million people. That seems right, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe it's a bit higher or lower? I'm going to stick with 2.1 million for now because that's what I remember hearing before.\n",
