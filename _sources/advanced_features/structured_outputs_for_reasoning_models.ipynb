    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Alright, so the user is in New York and wants to know the current date and time along with the weather. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I need to figure out how to get the current date and time for New York. Looking at the available functions, there's 'get_current_date' which requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I can use the 'America/New_York' timezone. That should give me the correct date and time.<br><br>Next, the weather part. The function 'get_current_weather' needs a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, but I should check the state abbreviation. New York's state is NY. The unit is probably Fahrenheit since that's common in the US, but I'm not sure. I should include 'fahrenheit' as the unit parameter.<br><br>Now, I need to make sure I'm using the functions correctly. For the date, I'll call 'get_current_date' with {'timezone': 'America/New_York'}. For the weather, I'll call 'get_current_weather' with the city as 'New York', state as 'NY', and unit as 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>I should structure the response by first calling one function and then the other. Since the user asked for both, I'll present them in order. I'll make sure to include the parameters in the correct format, using JSON within the function calls.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write the function calls one after the other. The date function first, then the weather function. I'll also add sources to each function call to show where the parameters came from, like the user specifying the city and state.<br><br>Wait, does the user know the state? They didn't specify, so I'll have to assume it's NY. That should be fine. Also, I should make sure the parameters are correctly formatted and that each function call is on its own line.<br><br>I think that's all. I'll format the response with each function call on separate lines, each with their respective parameters. That should meet the user's request accurately.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'c1222b555e2a41b794c61df8ffe9adab', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.5817692279815674}}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out what exactly the user is asking for. They want data about the capital, which is Paris, specifically its population. They also mentioned \"information,\" but since they mentioned population, I\\'ll assume it\\'s the population figure they need.\\n\\nI should start by recalling the current population of Paris. I know it\\'s a major city and it\\'s been growing, so I can’t just state a fixed number. It\\'s probably around 2 million, but I shouldn\\'t be too certain. Maybe I should check a reliable source or recent data to make it accurate.\\n\\nWait, I\\'m remembering that Paris has a population around 2.1 to 2.2 million. But I have to confirm this. Let me think... I believe official sources like the census usually put it at approximately 2,170,000 as of 2023. That sounds right.\\n\\nNow, structuring this information in JSON format is next. JSON requires an object with key-value pairs. The user is focusing on the capital\\'s population, so I\\'ll need keys like \"city_name,\" \"country,\" and \"population.\" Also, including a \"notes\" section could be helpful, such as mentioning that the population is up-to-date and might change occasionally.\\n\\nI should make sure each key is a string and the population is a number type. It\\'s also a good idea to include English-Spanish translations of the keys since the user might be working with that. Oh, but I need to avoid markdown in my response, so I\\'ll just stick to the JSON syntax with proper braces and brackets.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll draft the JSON object. Let me double-check the population figure to ensure accuracy. Yes, 2,170,000 seems correct. I\\'ll present the JSON neatly, making sure there are no syntax errors.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll review the entire response to ensure clarity and that all information is up-to-date. That should cover everything the user asked for.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city_name\": \"Paris, France\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"population\": 2170000,\\n  \"notes\": \"Population figure is up-to-date as of recent estimates.\"\\n}\\n``` \\n\\nThis JSON object includes the city name, country, population, and a note about the data being current.', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 358, 1101, 2684, 264, 3239, 504, 264, 1196, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1128, 6896, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 13, 2379, 1366, 821, 911, 279, 6722, 11, 892, 374, 12095, 11, 11689, 1181, 7042, 13, 2379, 1083, 9733, 330, 25069, 1335, 714, 2474, 807, 9733, 7042, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 279, 7042, 7071, 807, 1184, 382, 40, 1265, 1191, 553, 88646, 279, 1482, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 358, 1414, 432, 594, 264, 3598, 3283, 323, 432, 594, 1012, 7826, 11, 773, 358, 646, 1405, 1101, 1584, 264, 8356, 1372, 13, 1084, 594, 4658, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 13133, 944, 387, 2238, 3654, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 476, 3213, 821, 311, 1281, 432, 13382, 382, 14190, 11, 358, 2776, 47284, 429, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 311, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 13, 1988, 358, 614, 311, 7683, 419, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 1112, 358, 4411, 3946, 8173, 1075, 279, 43602, 5990, 2182, 432, 518, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 2938, 10362, 1290, 382, 7039, 11, 2036, 1677, 419, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 374, 1790, 13, 4718, 7460, 458, 1633, 448, 1376, 19083, 13530, 13, 576, 1196, 374, 21080, 389, 279, 6722, 594, 7042, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1184, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 1269, 1335, 330, 11141, 1335, 323, 330, 44441, 1189, 7281, 11, 2670, 264, 330, 18286, 1, 3772, 1410, 387, 10950, 11, 1741, 438, 44291, 429, 279, 7042, 374, 705, 4686, 18413, 323, 2578, 2297, 22930, 382, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 1817, 1376, 374, 264, 914, 323, 279, 7042, 374, 264, 1372, 943, 13, 1084, 594, 1083, 264, 1661, 4522, 311, 2924, 6364, 12, 61797, 36693, 315, 279, 6894, 2474, 279, 1196, 2578, 387, 3238, 448, 429, 13, 8670, 11, 714, 358, 1184, 311, 5648, 50494, 304, 847, 2033, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1101, 9214, 311, 279, 4718, 19482, 448, 6169, 59191, 323, 38929, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 9960, 279, 4718, 1633, 13, 6771, 752, 1990, 15934, 279, 7042, 7071, 311, 5978, 13403, 13, 7414, 11, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 4977, 4396, 13, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 62166, 11, 3259, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 19482, 5975, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3395, 279, 4453, 2033, 311, 5978, 31273, 323, 429, 678, 1995, 374, 705, 4686, 18413, 13, 2938, 1265, 3421, 4297, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 8926, 1269, 788, 330, 59604, 11, 9625, 756, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 220, 330, 18286, 788, 330, 53371, 7071, 374, 705, 4686, 18413, 438, 315, 3213, 17530, 10040, 532, 73594, 4710, 1986, 4718, 1633, 5646, 279, 3283, 829, 11, 3146, 11, 7042, 11, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 1660, 1482, 13, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '0225cdbc30d24a7a9ccfea164d2ecb0c', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 536, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.3112199306488037}}</strong>"
