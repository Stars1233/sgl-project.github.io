    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes.

For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the current date and time in New York, along with the weather. The user mentioned I should use the functions 'get_current_weather' and 'get_current_date'. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I'll tackle the date and time. I remember the function requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I need to provide the correct timezone string. I think it's 'America/New_York'. So I'll structure the function call as get_current_date with the timezone set to 'America/New_York'.<br><br>Next, the weather. The function needs a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, but I should check the two-letter state abbreviation. New York is NY, so the state is 'NY'. The unit should be Fahrenheit since the user mentioned they're in New York, and I think Fahrenheit is commonly used there, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it might default to Celsius, so I should confirm if the unit parameter is optional or required. Looking back at the function's description, it says the unit is required, so I have to specify either 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'. I'll go with 'fahrenheit' for this case.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll call get_current_date first with the timezone and then get_current_weather with the city, state, and unit. I need to make sure each function call is on a separate line with the correct parameters in JSON format.<br><br>Wait, the user didn't specify if they want both functions in one message or separate. I think it's better to call them sequentially in the same message to provide a comprehensive answer. So I'll structure it as two separate function calls within the same message, each on its own line.<br><br>I should also add sources to the answer. For the date and time, since I'm using the function, I'll mention that I used the get_current_date function. Similarly, for the weather, I'll attribute it to get_current_weather. This way, the user knows where the information came from.<br><br>Let me double-check the parameters to make sure I didn't miss anything. For get_current_date, the timezone is correct. For get_current_weather, city is 'New York', state is 'NY', and unit is 'fahrenheit'. Yep, that's all covered.<br><br>I think I'm ready to write the response now, making sure each function call is properly formatted with the parameters in JSON.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><br><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, okay, let\\'s break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out which city is the capital of France. I think Paris is the capital, but I\\'m not entirely sure. I remember learning that Paris is the main city there, but maybe there\\'s a chance it\\'s something else? Wait, no, I\\'m pretty confident it\\'s Paris. Okay, so the capital is definitely Paris.\\n\\nNow, the user wants the population, but I can\\'t just give them a number because I don\\'t remember the exact figure. I should mention that the data I have might be an estimate. I should probably check if there\\'s the latest population figure available from a reliable source. But since I don\\'t have access to the internet, I\\'ll have to make it clear that the information might not be current.\\n\\nSo, I should structure the JSON with country as France, capital as Paris, and then note that the population is an estimate from 2023. That makes sense. I should format it properly, using the correct keys: \"country\" and \"capital\" with their respective values, and then add a comment or note about the population estimate.\\n\\nWait, should I also include the country code? The user didn\\'t specify, but it\\'s good practice to include it for completeness. So, countryCode would be \"FR\". That way, if someone else uses this data, they can easily identify the country.\\n\\nLet me put it all together. The JSON structure would be an object with country, countryCode, capital, and population. The population field will have a number and a note explaining it\\'s an estimate. That should cover everything the user asked for.\\n\\nI need to make sure the JSON is correctly formatted, with commas in the right places and keys in quotes. Let me visualize it: {\"country\": \"France\", \"countryCode\": \"FR\", \"capital\": \"Paris, Île-de-France, France\", \"population\": { \"year\": 2023, \"estimated\": true, \"number\": \"9,079,000\" }}. Hmm, I think that\\'s right. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can present the population as a string directly, like \"Approx. 9 million,\" and include the year as 2023. That might make it clearer for the user without getting too technical. I should also make sure that the capital\\'s description includes the region it\\'s in, like Île-de-France, to give more context.\\n\\nOkay, I think that\\'s a solid response.

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty straightforward. But the user wants the population, so I need to find the most recent data available. I remember that population numbers can change every year, so I should check the latest statistics. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the current population is around 2.2 million. I believe that's as of 2023, but I should verify that. Maybe I can recall that Paris has a diverse population with a mix of French and international residents. Also, considering the city's economy is mainly based on tourism and digital industries, the population might be growing, but it's not astronomically high like some other megacities.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll need to define a key for the city name and another for the population. Including the year would make it clear when the data was current.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, is there any other relevant information they might find useful? Maybe the area or some notable landmarks? But the user specifically asked for population, so I'll stick to that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted with correct syntax to avoid any errors when they use it. No markdown or special formatting beyond JSON syntax, so I'll keep it simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should have the city name and population as keys with their respective values. I'll double-check the population number to ensure accuracy. If I'm unsure, I might mention that the data is up to a certain year, but in this case, I think 2023 is the latest I can recall.\n",
