    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '208346a141cb417b94d2b29c92517c5e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.4515433311462402}}</strong>"

The user is looking for a structured response, probably for data integration or display purposes. They want it in JSON, which is common for data exchange.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify which city is the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Next, I have to find reliable data about its population. Population stats can vary, so I should use the most recent and accurate figure. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Paris had a population of around 2.1 million. However, I should note that this number can change due to births, deaths, and migration.\\n\\nNow, structuring the JSON. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I should include the city name and population as separate objects. Making sure the keys are clear and the values are accurate is crucial here.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user needs additional information, but since they specifically asked for the capital and population, I\\'ll stick to that. providing the population with a note on the variation can add a bit of context and show attention to detail, which might be appreciated.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll create a JSON object with two properties: \"City\" and \"Population\". The population will include an approximate figure and a note. Then, I\\'ll present this information to the user, ensuring it\\'s clear and meets their request.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"City\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Population\": {\\n    \"Approximate\": 2140000,\\n    \"Note\": \"Population as of recent estimates; may vary slightly due to births, deaths, and migration.\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 702, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 31065, 419, 13, 576, 1196, 374, 3330, 369, 264, 32930, 2033, 11, 4658, 369, 821, 17590, 476, 3037, 9895, 13, 2379, 1366, 432, 304, 4718, 11, 892, 374, 4185, 369, 821, 9289, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 892, 3283, 374, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 9295, 11, 358, 614, 311, 1477, 14720, 821, 911, 1181, 7042, 13, 39529, 10472, 646, 13289, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 990, 279, 1429, 3213, 323, 13382, 7071, 13, 1634, 315, 847, 6540, 44279, 304, 6527, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 3526, 13, 4354, 11, 358, 1265, 5185, 429, 419, 1372, 646, 2297, 4152, 311, 65232, 11, 16375, 11, 323, 11906, 382, 7039, 11, 2036, 1677, 279, 4718, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 2924, 279, 3283, 829, 323, 7042, 438, 8651, 6171, 13, 24288, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 279, 2750, 525, 13382, 374, 16587, 1588, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 421, 279, 1196, 3880, 5107, 1995, 11, 714, 2474, 807, 11689, 4588, 369, 279, 6722, 323, 7042, 11, 358, 3278, 9214, 311, 429, 13, 8241, 279, 7042, 448, 264, 5185, 389, 279, 22990, 646, 912, 264, 2699, 315, 2266, 323, 1473, 6529, 311, 7716, 11, 892, 2578, 387, 25808, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 264, 4718, 1633, 448, 1378, 5888, 25, 330, 12730, 1, 323, 330, 53371, 3263, 576, 7042, 686, 2924, 458, 44868, 7071, 323, 264, 5185, 13, 5005, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 419, 1995, 311, 279, 1196, 11, 22573, 432, 594, 2797, 323, 20027, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 12730, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 53371, 788, 341, 262, 330, 69520, 3426, 788, 220, 17, 16, 19, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 262, 330, 9112, 788, 330, 53371, 438, 315, 3213, 17530, 26, 1231, 13289, 10078, 4152, 311, 65232, 11, 16375, 11, 323, 11906, 10040, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'a427e1a4c88f4f83b127a5e202e88ea1', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 382, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.345521926879883}}</strong>"
