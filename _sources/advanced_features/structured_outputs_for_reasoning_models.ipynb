    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '055e1055a5de44d1b711848a5f686ccc', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.346787691116333}}</strong>"

Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s a given, but just to be sure, I might double-check that. Paris is definitely the administrative center and a major city in France, so yeah, that\\'s correct.\\n\\nNext, I need to figure out the population. Populations can change over time, so I should make sure I\\'m getting the most recent data. I remember reading somewhere that Paris has a population around 2 million, but I\\'m not certain about the exact number. Maybe it\\'s a bit higher now because of recent growth or migration.\\n\\nI should also consider the year the population is measured. If it\\'s from 2021, the number might be slightly different. Let me try to recall or find that figure. I think it\\'s approximately 2,154,000 people. But I\\'m not 100% sure, so perhaps I should look it up or double-check against up-to-date sources to confirm the准确ness.\\n\\nNow, structuring this into JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs. So the keys I need are probably \"City\" and \"Population\". The Population value should be an integer type, and the City, of course, is \"Paris\".\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure would have an object with \"City\" having the value \"Paris\" and \"Population\" having the value 2154000. Since the user requested it in JSON format, I should present it like this within square brackets, starting and ending with quotation marks appropriately.\\n\\nI should also make sure that the formatting is correct, with commas and colons in the right places, and the keys in quotes. No trailing spaces or other formatting issues should be present.\\n\\nLastly, I should consider if there are any other relevant details, but the user specifically asked for population and the city, so I don\\'t need to include extra information.\\n\\nAlright, I think I\\'ve got it all together. Now I\\'ll present the JSON as required.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"City\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Population\": 2154000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 773, 358, 2684, 264, 1681, 311, 3410, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 911, 1246, 311, 5486, 419, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 13, 2938, 594, 264, 2661, 11, 714, 1101, 311, 387, 2704, 11, 358, 2578, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 12095, 374, 8491, 279, 22707, 4126, 323, 264, 3598, 3283, 304, 9625, 11, 773, 21639, 11, 429, 594, 4396, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 7042, 13, 10254, 7455, 646, 2297, 916, 882, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 358, 2776, 3709, 279, 1429, 3213, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 5290, 14696, 429, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 3654, 911, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 432, 594, 264, 2699, 5080, 1431, 1576, 315, 3213, 6513, 476, 11906, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 279, 1042, 279, 7042, 374, 16878, 13, 1416, 432, 594, 504, 220, 17, 15, 17, 16, 11, 279, 1372, 2578, 387, 10078, 2155, 13, 6771, 752, 1430, 311, 19091, 476, 1477, 429, 7071, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 16, 20, 19, 11, 15, 15, 15, 1251, 13, 1988, 358, 2776, 537, 220, 16, 15, 15, 4, 2704, 11, 773, 8365, 358, 1265, 1401, 432, 705, 476, 1990, 15934, 2348, 705, 4686, 18413, 8173, 311, 7683, 279, 102188, 2090, 382, 7039, 11, 2036, 1677, 419, 1119, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 13, 2055, 279, 6894, 358, 1184, 525, 4658, 330, 12730, 1, 323, 330, 53371, 3263, 576, 39529, 897, 1265, 387, 458, 7546, 943, 11, 323, 279, 4311, 11, 315, 3308, 11, 374, 330, 59604, 11436, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 5944, 1035, 614, 458, 1633, 448, 330, 12730, 1, 3432, 279, 897, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 330, 53371, 1, 3432, 279, 897, 220, 17, 16, 20, 19, 15, 15, 15, 13, 8704, 279, 1196, 11223, 432, 304, 4718, 3561, 11, 358, 1265, 3042, 432, 1075, 419, 2878, 9334, 38929, 11, 5916, 323, 13391, 448, 54231, 15423, 34901, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 1281, 2704, 429, 279, 36566, 374, 4396, 11, 448, 76602, 323, 1375, 2382, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 11, 323, 279, 6894, 304, 17194, 13, 2308, 27748, 12621, 476, 1008, 36566, 4714, 1265, 387, 3042, 382, 80486, 11, 358, 1265, 2908, 421, 1052, 525, 894, 1008, 9760, 3565, 11, 714, 279, 1196, 11689, 4588, 369, 7042, 323, 279, 3283, 11, 773, 358, 1513, 944, 1184, 311, 2924, 4960, 1995, 382, 71486, 11, 358, 1744, 358, 3003, 2684, 432, 678, 3786, 13, 4695, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 438, 2567, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 12730, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 53371, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 19, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '10cfc71f72e949549aaf63f049738f83', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 486, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.2222776412963867}}</strong>"

Hmm, I know that the capital of France is Paris, but I'm not exactly sure about the current population number. I remember hearing it's around 8 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I think the population has been growing over the years. Maybe around 8.5 million? Or is it 8.1 million? I should check that.\n",

Maybe the population of Paris is about 12-13% of the total population? Let me see, 12% of 40 million is 4.8 million, and 13% is about 5.2 million. But that doesn't make sense because I thought Paris was much larger. Maybe I'm mixing up the numbers.\n",

I believe as of recent estimates, Paris has a population of around 8.6 million people. That seems more accurate. I think I've seen that number mentioned before in various sources. So, I'll go with that figure.\n",
