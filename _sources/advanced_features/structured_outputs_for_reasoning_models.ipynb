    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The user mentioned they're in New York, so I should probably use both 'get_current_date' and 'get_current_weather'. <br><br>For the date, I'll call 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter set to 'America/New_York'. That should give me the current date and time in their local time zone.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I'll need the city and state. The user is in New York, so the state would be 'NY'. The unit isn't specified, so I'll default to Fahrenheit. So I'll call 'get_current_weather' with city as 'New York', state as 'NY', and unit as 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>I should structure the response by first stating the date and time, then the weather conditions, including temperature, condition description, and any other relevant details like humidity or wind speed if available.<br><br>I need to make sure each function call is properly formatted with the correct parameters. Also, I should present the information clearly, perhaps starting with the date and time, followed by the weather details.<br><br>Wait, should I check if there's a smarter way to get both date and weather in one call? But the user specified two separate requests, so it's better to handle them individually for clarity.<br><br>I also need to ensure that I'm using the correct function names and parameters as per the instructions. Each function call should be on its own line, starting with <function=...> and ending with </function>.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll first reply with the date and time using the date function, then the weather using the weather function.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear.

Hmm, I should first figure out which city that is. I know the capital of France is Paris, right? Got it.\\n\\nNow, I need to recall the population. I\\'m not 100% sure, but I think it\\'s around 2 million. Wait, but maybe it\\'s a bit higher now. I should double-check that number. Oh, right, Paris has grown a bit over the years, so maybe it\\'s approximately 2.18 million as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNext, for the information part. I should include the administrative division, so Paris is in Ile-de-France. The prefecture is also in Île-de-France, which is good to mention. The area is about 105 square kilometers. As for the铆urboat, I\\'m not exactly sure how many kaynağı are there. I think it\\'s a significant part of the city, maybe around 6,600 annually.\\n\\nPutting this into JSON format. I should structure it with \"capital\" as a key, containing all the relevant details. Maybe break it down into \"administrative\", \"geographical\", and \"demographics\" for clarity. That makes the information organized and easy to read.\\n\\nOh, and I should make sure the numbers are up to date. I remember population figures can change, so using the latest estimate is important. Also, I should present the JSON cleanly, maybe using proper indentation so it\\'s readable.\\n\\nWait, did the user specify any particular fields they need? They just asked for population and information, so I should cover both. Maybe include the population growth rate too, that could be useful. I think Paris\\'s growth rate is around 1.1% annually.\\n\\nLet me assemble this:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"administrative\": {\\n      \"region\": \"Ile-de-France\",\\n      \"prefecture\": \"Île-de-France\"\\n    },\\n    \"geographical\": {\\n      \"area\": 105,\\n      \"uries\": 6600\\n    },\\n    \"demographics\": {\\n      \"population\": 2182000,\\n      \"growth_rate\": 1.1\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nYeah, that looks comprehensive. I hope that covers all the user\\'s requirements.

Hmm, first I need to figure out who the user is and what they're trying to achieve. They want a structured response, probably for easy parsing or integration into another system.\n",

I remember that the population has been growing, but I'm not sure of the exact numbers. I'll have to check a reliable source.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, structuring this into JSON. The user didn't specify the exact format, but they mentioned JSON, so I'll create a proper JSON object. It should have a key like \"capital\" pointing to \"Paris\" and another key like \"population\" with the number. I'll include the note about the population being approximate and the year for context.\n",

      "I should also make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and brackets. Maybe I'll format it neatly for readability, but since it's a response, it can be a single line as well. Oh, and the key names should be in lowercase as per JSON standards.\n",

      "Putting it all together, the JSON object should be clear and concise. I should double-check the population number to ensure accuracy. If I'm unsure, it's better to mention that the data is approximate. That way, the user knows there might be slight variations over time.\n",
