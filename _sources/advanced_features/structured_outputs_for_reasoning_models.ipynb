    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",

    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the current date and time in New York and the weather there using the functions provided. Let me start by understanding what each function does.<br><br>First, there's the get_current_weather function. It requires a city, state, and unit. Since I'm in New York, I know the city is \"New York\", the state is \"NY\", and I probably want the temperature in Fahrenheit since that's the standard unit here. So I can call get_current_weather with these parameters.<br><br>Next, for the current date and time in New York, I need to use get_current_date. This function takes a timezone parameter. New York is in the \"America/New_York\" timezone, so I'll pass that in.<br><br>I should make sure to call these functions one after the other. Maybe I can first get the date and time, then the weather, or vice versa. The user didn't specify the order, so either way is fine. But since they asked for both, I'll probably structure the response to include both pieces of information.<br><br>I need to make sure I format the function calls correctly. Each function call should be on its own line, with the function name and parameters in the specified JSON format. Also, I should include the source for each function call, probably from the provided documentation.<br><br>Wait, the user's example shows how to call a function, so I should follow that structure. Each function call should be within its own start and end tags, with the function name and parameters correctly placed. Also, I should mention where the information comes from, like the get_current_weather function's documentation.<br><br>Let me outline the steps:<br><br>1. Call get_current_date with timezone \"America/New_York\".<br>2. Call get_current_weather with city \"New York\", state \"NY\", unit \"fahrenheit\".<br>3. Present both results clearly, each with their source mentioned.<br><br>I should also ensure that the parameters are correctly formatted as a JSON object within the function call. No markdown, just plain text with the tags as specified.<br><br>Double-checking the functions' requirements: get_current_weather needs city, state, and unit. get_current_date needs timezone.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I should identify the capital of France, which is definitely Paris. That\\'s straightforward.\\n\\nNext, they want the population. I know that population numbers can change over time, so I\\'ll have to consider the most recent data. I think the population figure I have is from 2023, so I\\'ll go with approximately 3.5 million. I should mention that the figure may vary slightly due to factors like迁徙 and natural growth.\\n\\nWait, does the user know that populations can fluctuate? Maybe they need that detail, so adding something about it makes sense. \\n\\nPutting it all together, I should format it in JSON. The structure should have a key for the information and population. It\\'s important to keep it clean and easy to read. Also, providing an example of how the JSON can be used could be helpful. That way, the user knows exactly how to use the data they\\'re getting.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON is valid and correctly formatted. Also, think about why the user is asking this. Maybe they\\'re working on a project, writing a report, or just curious. Either way, clear and accurate information is key.\\n\\nDouble-checking the population number for accuracy. I recall that Paris has a population just under 3.5 million, so 3,500,000 should be accurate enough for most purposes.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll structure the response by first stating Paris is the capital, then provide the population in the JSON format, and add the example usage to help them utilize the data effectively.\\n\\nI think that covers everything the user asked for. Hopefully, this addresses all their requirements clearly.\\n</think>\\n\\nCertainly! The capital of France is Paris, and its population is approximately 3.5 million. Here is the information in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": \"3,500,000\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExample usage:\\n```javascript\\nconst data = {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": \"3,500,000\"};\\nconsole.log(data);\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 5889, 311, 419, 1196, 594, 3239, 13, 2379, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1265, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 11, 892, 374, 8491, 12095, 13, 2938, 594, 30339, 382, 5847, 11, 807, 1366, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 7042, 5109, 646, 2297, 916, 882, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 614, 311, 2908, 279, 1429, 3213, 821, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 7042, 7071, 358, 614, 374, 504, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 13187, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 13, 358, 1265, 6286, 429, 279, 7071, 1231, 13289, 10078, 4152, 311, 9363, 1075, 100287, 119414, 323, 5810, 6513, 382, 14190, 11, 1558, 279, 1196, 1414, 429, 21910, 646, 38288, 6292, 30, 10696, 807, 1184, 429, 7716, 11, 773, 7842, 2494, 911, 432, 3643, 5530, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 1265, 3561, 432, 304, 4718, 13, 576, 5944, 1265, 614, 264, 1376, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 13, 1084, 594, 2989, 311, 2506, 432, 4240, 323, 4135, 311, 1349, 13, 7281, 11, 8241, 458, 3110, 315, 1246, 279, 4718, 646, 387, 1483, 1410, 387, 10950, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 279, 1196, 8788, 6896, 1246, 311, 990, 279, 821, 807, 2299, 3709, 382, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 323, 12440, 23126, 13, 7281, 11, 1744, 911, 3170, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 419, 13, 10696, 807, 2299, 3238, 389, 264, 2390, 11, 4378, 264, 1895, 11, 476, 1101, 22208, 13, 20988, 1616, 11, 2797, 323, 13382, 1995, 374, 1376, 382, 7378, 15934, 287, 279, 7042, 1372, 369, 13403, 13, 358, 19091, 429, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 1101, 1212, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 11, 773, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 1265, 387, 13382, 3322, 369, 1429, 9895, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 5944, 279, 2033, 553, 1156, 27798, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 1221, 3410, 279, 7042, 304, 279, 4718, 3561, 11, 323, 912, 279, 3110, 10431, 311, 1492, 1105, 28066, 279, 821, 13444, 382, 40, 1744, 429, 14521, 4297, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 13, 37894, 11, 419, 14230, 678, 862, 8502, 9355, 624, 151649, 271, 95456, 0, 576, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 11, 323, 1181, 7042, 374, 13187, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 13, 5692, 374, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 330, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 698, 532, 13874, 19324, 13314, 10431, 510, 73594, 14073, 198, 1024, 821, 284, 5212, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 330, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 26690, 5354, 1665, 2592, 317, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'e69a9f8012fa4770a44be4bfbad22dcf', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 469, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.377047538757324}}</strong>"

      "First, I need to identify what exactly the user is asking for. The capital of France is Paris, right? So that's the starting point. They want both general information and the population, all in JSON. JSON format means I'll need to structure it properly with key-value pairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think about the general information about Paris. Well, it's a major city, the capital, and a global metropolis. It's known for its rich history, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, and it's a cultural and economic hub. Including such points will give a comprehensive overview.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, for the population. I should be careful here because population numbers can change over time. I remember that as of recent estimates, Paris has a population around 2.1 million people. But it's always good to mention that this figure can vary depending on the source and the year. Maybe I should include a note about the approximate figure and the factors affecting population changes, like births, deaths, and migration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with an \"info\" key containing the general details and a \"population\" key with the number and a note. I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, using commas appropriately and ensuring the keys are in quotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include any additional data points? Maybe the metropolitan area population? Paris's metropolitan area is larger, around 8 million. But since the user specifically asked for the capital, I'll stick to Paris proper. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also need to ensure that the JSON is valid. Let me double-check the syntax: commas, correct braces, and proper key-value pairs. No trailing commas after the last item, that's a common mistake.\n",
