    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '58d3be78577e4c2a93016681ca3da7fa', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3429675102233887}}</strong>"

Let me figure this out step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the capital of France is definitely Paris. Got that. Now, I need to find the most recent population data for Paris. I remember that populations can change every decade, so I should check which year the data is from. The 2020 census is the most recent one, so I\\'ll go with that.\\n\\nI should structure this in JSON. The user probably wants a clear and concise response, so I\\'ll create a JSON object with the key \"capital\" containing the city, \"population\" with the number, and maybe \"year\" for the data. \\n\\nI need to make sure the population number is accurate. From what I recall, the population of Paris is around 2 million. But to be precise, I should look up the exact number. Wait, no, actually, the population figure might be a bit outdated. Let me think—has it changed since 2020? Probably not drastically, but it\\'s good to confirm. I believe it\\'s approximately 2.1 million, but maybe it\\'s closer to 2.2. Wait, I think it\\'s around 2,170,000. Hmm, I\\'m not entirely sure. Maybe I should double-check that. Okay, so let\\'s go with that number.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look clean, with proper capitalization and numbering. I\\'ll structure it so the keys are in lowercase and separated by commas. That way, the JSON is valid and can be used reliably without issues.\\n\\nI\\'m also considering if the user might need additional information or a different format, but since they specifically asked for JSON, I\\'ll stick to that. Maybe they\\'re using it for a project or a presentation where structured data is necessary. No need to complicate it further.\\n\\nAlright, so summarizing, the JSON object will have the capital, population, and the year. Keeping it simple and to the point. I think that covers the user\\'s request effectively without adding unnecessary details. Hopefully, this answers their question accurately.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2170000,\\n  \"year\": 2020\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 7071, 419, 700, 3019, 553, 3019, 382, 5338, 11, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 8491, 12095, 13, 24528, 429, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 369, 12095, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 21910, 646, 2297, 1449, 13212, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 1779, 892, 1042, 279, 821, 374, 504, 13, 576, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 374, 279, 1429, 3213, 825, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 429, 382, 40, 1265, 5944, 419, 304, 4718, 13, 576, 1196, 4658, 6801, 264, 2797, 323, 63594, 2033, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 264, 4718, 1633, 448, 279, 1376, 330, 65063, 1, 8482, 279, 3283, 11, 330, 44441, 1, 448, 279, 1372, 11, 323, 7196, 330, 3157, 1, 369, 279, 821, 13, 4710, 40, 1184, 311, 1281, 2704, 279, 7042, 1372, 374, 13382, 13, 5542, 1128, 358, 19091, 11, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 374, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 13, 1988, 311, 387, 23560, 11, 358, 1265, 1401, 705, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 13824, 11, 902, 11, 3520, 11, 279, 7042, 7071, 2578, 387, 264, 2699, 40526, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 2293, 4648, 432, 5497, 2474, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 30, 37154, 537, 47763, 11, 714, 432, 594, 1661, 311, 7683, 13, 358, 4411, 432, 594, 13187, 220, 17, 13, 16, 3526, 11, 714, 7196, 432, 594, 12128, 311, 220, 17, 13, 17, 13, 13824, 11, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 13, 88190, 11, 358, 2776, 537, 11368, 2704, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 35439, 11, 773, 1077, 594, 728, 448, 429, 1372, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 4240, 11, 448, 6169, 6722, 2022, 323, 78262, 13, 358, 3278, 5944, 432, 773, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 42047, 323, 18663, 553, 76602, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 323, 646, 387, 1483, 56382, 2041, 4714, 382, 40, 2776, 1083, 12831, 421, 279, 1196, 2578, 1184, 5107, 1995, 476, 264, 2155, 3561, 11, 714, 2474, 807, 11689, 4588, 369, 4718, 11, 358, 3278, 9214, 311, 429, 13, 10696, 807, 2299, 1667, 432, 369, 264, 2390, 476, 264, 15496, 1380, 32930, 821, 374, 5871, 13, 2308, 1184, 311, 1367, 48795, 432, 4623, 382, 71486, 11, 773, 28285, 4849, 11, 279, 4718, 1633, 686, 614, 279, 6722, 11, 7042, 11, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 55378, 432, 4285, 323, 311, 279, 1459, 13, 358, 1744, 429, 14521, 279, 1196, 594, 1681, 13444, 2041, 7842, 25165, 3565, 13, 37894, 11, 419, 11253, 862, 3405, 29257, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 220, 330, 3157, 788, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '1b2b90d93d74480e8b0d94b14e2de794', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 501, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.0703351497650146}}</strong>"
