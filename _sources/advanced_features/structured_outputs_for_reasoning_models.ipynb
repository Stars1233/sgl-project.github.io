    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '77dad6d535454349a75f9c35854ed099', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.4238555431365967}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to find the information and population of the capital of France, which is Paris, and present it in JSON format. Let me think through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is indeed Paris. That part is straightforward. Now, for the population. I remember hearing that Paris is one of the largest cities in the world, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I recall that it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not certain if it\\'s 3.5 million or more. I should probably look that up to make sure.\\n\\nI think looking it up is the best way to get the correct and most recent population figure. But since I\\'m just recalling, maybe 3.5 million is about right. Let me make sure. Oh, wait, I\\'m pretty sure that as of the latest estimates, Paris has a population of around 3.5 to 3.6 million people. Some sources might say 3.59 million, which is about 3.6 million when rounded.\\n\\nSo, now I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a way to represent data structures in a readable manner. The structure typically involves key-value pairs. For this case, the keys would probably be \"city\" and \"population\". The value for \"city\" is straightforward—it\\'s \"Paris\". The value for \"population\" would be the number I just recalled, which I think is approximately 3.5 to 3.6 million.\\n\\nI should also consider whether the population figure is an average, maximum, or another metric. Since population figures can change every year, it\\'s best to provide an estimate. So, I\\'ll go with 3.59 million as a precise number.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure would have a key \"capital\" with two nested objects: one for the city name and another for the population. So it would look like {\"capital\": {\"city\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 3590000}}. That makes sense because it neatly organizes the information into separate fields for clarity.\\n\\nI should make sure that the JSON syntax is correct, with proper quotation marks and commas. Also, there shouldn\\'t be any trailing commas after the object values. So, the JSON should correctly represent the data without any syntax errors.\\n\\nIn summary, I\\'m pretty confident that Paris is the capital, and the population is roughly 3.59 million. Representing this in JSON format with the keys \"city\" and \"population\" inside an \"capital\" object seems accurate and easy to read.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 3590000\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 11, 892, 374, 12095, 11, 323, 3042, 432, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 1526, 419, 3019, 553, 3019, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12824, 12095, 13, 2938, 949, 374, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 369, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 10778, 429, 12095, 374, 825, 315, 279, 7772, 9720, 304, 279, 1879, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 19091, 429, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 3654, 421, 432, 594, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 476, 803, 13, 358, 1265, 4658, 1401, 429, 705, 311, 1281, 2704, 382, 40, 1744, 3330, 432, 705, 374, 279, 1850, 1616, 311, 633, 279, 4396, 323, 1429, 3213, 7042, 7071, 13, 1988, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 88646, 11, 7196, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 374, 911, 1290, 13, 6771, 752, 1281, 2704, 13, 8670, 11, 3783, 11, 358, 2776, 5020, 2704, 429, 438, 315, 279, 5535, 17530, 11, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 315, 2163, 220, 18, 13, 20, 311, 220, 18, 13, 21, 3526, 1251, 13, 4329, 8173, 2578, 1977, 220, 18, 13, 20, 24, 3526, 11, 892, 374, 911, 220, 18, 13, 21, 3526, 979, 17976, 382, 4416, 11, 1431, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11, 476, 12914, 3002, 2806, 367, 11, 374, 264, 1616, 311, 4009, 821, 14389, 304, 264, 33798, 11566, 13, 576, 5944, 11136, 17601, 1376, 19083, 13530, 13, 1752, 419, 1142, 11, 279, 6894, 1035, 4658, 387, 330, 8926, 1, 323, 330, 44441, 3263, 576, 897, 369, 330, 8926, 1, 374, 30339, 43503, 594, 330, 59604, 3263, 576, 897, 369, 330, 44441, 1, 1035, 387, 279, 1372, 358, 1101, 31130, 11, 892, 358, 1744, 374, 13187, 220, 18, 13, 20, 311, 220, 18, 13, 21, 3526, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 3425, 279, 7042, 7071, 374, 458, 5461, 11, 7192, 11, 476, 2441, 18266, 13, 8704, 7042, 12396, 646, 2297, 1449, 1042, 11, 432, 594, 1850, 311, 3410, 458, 16045, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 220, 18, 13, 20, 24, 3526, 438, 264, 23560, 1372, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 5944, 1035, 614, 264, 1376, 330, 65063, 1, 448, 1378, 24034, 6171, 25, 825, 369, 279, 3283, 829, 323, 2441, 369, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 432, 1035, 1401, 1075, 5212, 65063, 788, 5212, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 24, 15, 15, 15, 15, 3417, 13, 2938, 3643, 5530, 1576, 432, 62166, 2872, 4756, 279, 1995, 1119, 8651, 5043, 369, 31273, 382, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 429, 279, 4718, 19482, 374, 4396, 11, 448, 6169, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 13, 7281, 11, 1052, 13133, 944, 387, 894, 27748, 76602, 1283, 279, 1633, 2750, 13, 2055, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 12440, 4009, 279, 821, 2041, 894, 19482, 5975, 382, 641, 12126, 11, 358, 2776, 5020, 16506, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 323, 279, 7042, 374, 17267, 220, 18, 13, 20, 24, 3526, 13, 21950, 287, 419, 304, 4718, 3561, 448, 279, 6894, 330, 8926, 1, 323, 330, 44441, 1, 4766, 458, 330, 65063, 1, 1633, 4977, 13382, 323, 4135, 311, 1349, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 262, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 24, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '45169539b7134eb4b90558766d936912', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 580, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.947571277618408}}</strong>"

I think the latest data I have is from 2023, which might be updated, but I'll go with that unless I have more info.\n",

      "I should also consider including some related information like the region it's in, which is Île-de-France, and maybe a current date as of when the data was last updated. That way, the user gets a comprehensive piece of information.\n",

      "Putting it all together, the JSON structure would have an \"info\" object containing \"capital\" and \"capitalPopulation.\" Under \"capitalPopulation,\" I'll have the urban population and the metropolitan area population.
