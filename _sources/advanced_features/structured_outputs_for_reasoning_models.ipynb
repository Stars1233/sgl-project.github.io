    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I need to figure out how to get both pieces of information using the functions provided.<br><br>First, for the date and time, I should use the get_current_date function. The function requires a timezone parameter. New York is in the 'America/New_York' timezone, so I'll set that as the parameter. I'll call the function and include it in the specified format.<br><br>Next, the weather information. I should use the get_current_weather function. The city is New York, and I need the state, which is NY. The unit is probably Fahrenheit since that's a common default, but I should check if the function allows specifying that. Wait, looking at the function's parameters, it has a 'unit' property with enum ['celsius', 'fahrenheit']. I'll default to Fahrenheit unless the user specifies otherwise, but since the user didn't mention it, I'll include it as part of the parameters for clarity.<br><br>Now, I have to structure both function calls correctly. Each function should be called separately, so I'll make two separate function calls. The first one will be for the date and time, and the second for the weather.<br><br>I should also make sure to format each function call according to the specified structure: start_tag, function name, parameters in JSON format, and end_tag.

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '670273a5590e43d2a787a779ab26ebf4', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.551377296447754}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user just asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what exactly they\\'re asking for. The capital of France is Paris, so I know the city name is correct.\\n\\nNext, the population. I\\'m not exactly a statistics expert, but I remember that Paris is a major city and one of the largest in the EU. It\\'s probably in the millions. I\\'ll go with an estimated population of around 2.2 million people. I should mention that this is approximate and the number can vary depending on the source and time of the year because of people moving in or out.\\n\\nNow, the JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it\\'s commonly used to store data in an organized and structured way. The user wants this information in JSON, so I\\'ll create an object with relevant fields. Maybe \\'city\\' for the name, \\'population\\' for the numbers, and maybe an \\'area\\' if they\\'re interested in the city limits.\\n\\nI should also include a country name since the user specified France. It makes the data complete. I don\\'t need to add extra fields unless they specify, so I\\'ll keep it simple with city, population, and area.\\n\\nI wonder if there\\'s any additional context the user might need. Maybe they want to use this data elsewhere, so providing accurate and up-to-date information is crucial. Since I\\'m giving an estimate, I\\'ll note that the number can change, which shows I\\'m being transparent.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with the necessary keys and values. I\\'ll make sure the formatting is correct, using double quotes and proper commas. I shouldn\\'t forget to put the final JSON inside backticks as per the example I saw earlier.\\n\\nDouble-checking everything, the user\\'s request is straightforward. They just need the JSON with the details of Paris\\'s population. I think I\\'ve covered everything they asked for without overcomplicating it. Hopefully, this meets their needs and is clear.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2240000,\\n    \"country\": \"France\",\\n    \"area\": 107.13 km²\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON contains the following details:\\n- The name of the capital (Paris).\\n- An approximate population estimate for Paris (2,240,000).\\n- The country it belongs to (France).\\n- The area of the city limits (107.13 square kilometers). \\n\\nPlease note that the population figure is approximate and may vary depending on the source and the time of the year.', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 1101, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1128, 6896, 807, 2299, 10161, 369, 13, 576, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 11, 773, 358, 1414, 279, 3283, 829, 374, 4396, 382, 5847, 11, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 264, 13142, 6203, 11, 714, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 323, 825, 315, 279, 7772, 304, 279, 9812, 13, 1084, 594, 4658, 304, 279, 11728, 13, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 458, 12943, 7042, 315, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 1251, 13, 358, 1265, 6286, 429, 419, 374, 44868, 323, 279, 1372, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 882, 315, 279, 1042, 1576, 315, 1251, 7218, 304, 476, 700, 382, 7039, 11, 279, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 13352, 369, 12914, 3002, 2806, 367, 11, 323, 432, 594, 16626, 1483, 311, 3553, 821, 304, 458, 16645, 323, 32930, 1616, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 419, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 9760, 5043, 13, 10696, 364, 8926, 6, 369, 279, 829, 11, 364, 44441, 6, 369, 279, 5109, 11, 323, 7196, 458, 364, 4798, 6, 421, 807, 2299, 8014, 304, 279, 3283, 13388, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2924, 264, 3146, 829, 2474, 279, 1196, 5189, 9625, 13, 1084, 3643, 279, 821, 4583, 13, 358, 1513, 944, 1184, 311, 912, 4960, 5043, 7241, 807, 13837, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 2506, 432, 4285, 448, 3283, 11, 7042, 11, 323, 3082, 382, 40, 5775, 421, 1052, 594, 894, 5107, 2266, 279, 1196, 2578, 1184, 13, 10696, 807, 1366, 311, 990, 419, 821, 17920, 11, 773, 8241, 13382, 323, 705, 4686, 18413, 1995, 374, 16587, 13, 8704, 358, 2776, 7086, 458, 16045, 11, 358, 3278, 5185, 429, 279, 1372, 646, 2297, 11, 892, 4933, 358, 2776, 1660, 17821, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 5944, 279, 4718, 448, 279, 5871, 6894, 323, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 279, 36566, 374, 4396, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 323, 6169, 76602, 13, 358, 13133, 944, 10667, 311, 2182, 279, 1590, 4718, 4766, 1182, 35078, 438, 817, 279, 3110, 358, 5485, 6788, 382, 7378, 15934, 287, 4297, 11, 279, 1196, 594, 1681, 374, 30339, 13, 2379, 1101, 1184, 279, 4718, 448, 279, 3565, 315, 12095, 594, 7042, 13, 358, 1744, 358, 3003, 9761, 4297, 807, 4588, 369, 2041, 916, 5689, 415, 1095, 432, 13, 37894, 11, 419, 20027, 862, 3880, 323, 374, 2797, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 262, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 17, 19, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 262, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 262, 330, 4798, 788, 220, 16, 15, 22, 13, 16, 18, 13136, 29456, 198, 220, 456, 532, 13874, 19324, 1986, 4718, 5610, 279, 2701, 3565, 510, 12, 576, 829, 315, 279, 6722, 320, 59604, 4292, 12, 1527, 44868, 7042, 16045, 369, 12095, 320, 17, 11, 17, 19, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 4292, 12, 576, 3146, 432, 17180, 311, 320, 49000, 4292, 12, 576, 3082, 315, 279, 3283, 13388, 320, 16, 15, 22, 13, 16, 18, 9334, 40568, 568, 4710, 5501, 5185, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 374, 44868, 323, 1231, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 882, 315, 279, 1042, 13, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '84d84c6b6ab844438969ab99e1468fda', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 576, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.9755210876464844}}</strong>"
