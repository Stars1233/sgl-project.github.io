    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '423619923eb041248b8dcf70f26c6a26', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3454396724700928}}</strong>"

Hmm, I need to figure out where the capital is first. France\\'s capital is Paris, right? Okay, that\\'s straightforward.\\n\\nNext, I should gather details about Paris. Let me think, Paris has a population, but it\\'s a big city, so it\\'s estimates. I recall it\\'s around 2 to 3 million. Maybe 2.2 million? Yeah, that sounds right.\\n\\nAlso, Paris is known for a lot of landmarks. xeeshhh is a big one because it has the\"Eiffel Tower.\" Maybe I should include a couple of others, like the\"\"Notre-Dame Cathedral\" for the gothic style, and \"bridges\" though they are more symbolic than functional, maybe something like the\" \"\"\\n\\nWait, I should make sure the information is accurate. Population can vary a bit each year, but the estimate is commonly around 2.17 million as of 2023. Okay, I\\'ll include that.\\n\\nI need to format this in JSON. So the overall structure should be an object with a \"name\" key pointing to \"Paris\" and a \"data\" key which is another object containing population, landmarks, and maybe some other info like theEiffel Tower andLe Marais as a cultural hub.\\n\\nWait, the user included \" landmarks\" and \"cultural hub\" in their example. That\\'s helpful. Maybe I should just follow that structure.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll have a JSON object with the capital\\'s name and a nested object with population and other details. That should make it clear and easy to read.\\n\\nI think that\\'s all. Double-checking the facts to make sure nothing\\'s off. Yep, Paris is the capital, and the population is approximately 2.17 million. I\\'ll make sure to get the exact figure from a reliable source just to be safe.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"data\": {\\n    \"population\": 2170000,\\n    \"landmarks\": {\\n      \"Eiffel_Tower\": true,\\n      \"Notre-Dame_Cathedral\": true,\\n      \"Bridges\": true\\n    },\\n    \"cultural_hub\": \"Le Marais\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 4588, 752, 311, 3410, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1380, 279, 6722, 374, 1156, 13, 9625, 594, 6722, 374, 12095, 11, 1290, 30, 35439, 11, 429, 594, 30339, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1265, 9567, 3565, 911, 12095, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 11, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 11, 714, 432, 594, 264, 2409, 3283, 11, 773, 432, 594, 17530, 13, 358, 19091, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 311, 220, 18, 3526, 13, 10696, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 30, 21607, 11, 429, 10362, 1290, 382, 13394, 11, 12095, 374, 3881, 369, 264, 2696, 315, 59924, 13, 82790, 4288, 20367, 374, 264, 2409, 825, 1576, 432, 702, 279, 77199, 3092, 301, 21938, 1189, 10696, 358, 1265, 2924, 264, 5625, 315, 3800, 11, 1075, 279, 1, 81155, 265, 9420, 373, 56729, 1, 369, 279, 728, 81564, 1707, 11, 323, 330, 16223, 4188, 1, 3498, 807, 525, 803, 35296, 1091, 15629, 11, 7196, 2494, 1075, 279, 1, 35829, 14190, 11, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 1995, 374, 13382, 13, 39529, 646, 13289, 264, 2699, 1817, 1042, 11, 714, 279, 16045, 374, 16626, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 22, 3526, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 35439, 11, 358, 3278, 2924, 429, 382, 40, 1184, 311, 3561, 419, 304, 4718, 13, 2055, 279, 8084, 5944, 1265, 387, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 1376, 21633, 311, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 264, 330, 691, 1, 1376, 892, 374, 2441, 1633, 8482, 7042, 11, 59924, 11, 323, 7196, 1045, 1008, 3546, 1075, 279, 36, 3092, 301, 21938, 323, 2304, 2876, 2782, 438, 264, 12752, 18719, 382, 14190, 11, 279, 1196, 5230, 330, 59924, 1, 323, 330, 66, 43447, 18719, 1, 304, 862, 3110, 13, 2938, 594, 10950, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1101, 1795, 429, 5944, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 614, 264, 4718, 1633, 448, 279, 6722, 594, 829, 323, 264, 24034, 1633, 448, 7042, 323, 1008, 3565, 13, 2938, 1265, 1281, 432, 2797, 323, 4135, 311, 1349, 382, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 7093, 15934, 287, 279, 13064, 311, 1281, 2704, 4302, 594, 1007, 13, 84194, 11, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 323, 279, 7042, 374, 13187, 220, 17, 13, 16, 22, 3526, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 633, 279, 4734, 7071, 504, 264, 14720, 2530, 1101, 311, 387, 6092, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 691, 788, 341, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 262, 330, 1933, 15544, 788, 341, 414, 330, 36, 3092, 301, 1139, 1202, 788, 830, 345, 414, 330, 2623, 265, 9420, 373, 920, 587, 35520, 788, 830, 345, 414, 330, 33, 1869, 4188, 788, 830, 198, 262, 1153, 262, 330, 66, 43447, 93996, 788, 330, 2304, 2876, 2782, 698, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'c0061b95cd494dc8b8006cf52fcc5d1a', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 503, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.324833869934082}}</strong>"

I should check to make sure I have the most accurate number. From what I recall, the population is approximately 2,150,000 people as of 2023, but I'm not 100% certain.
