    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

The unit can be either Celsius or Fahrenheit; maybe I'll default to Fahrenheit since it's commonly used in the US.<br><br>Next, the get_current_date function needs a timezone.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear.

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. So I need to include that in the JSON. I should look up the current population of Paris. I recall that in recent years, Paris has had fluctuating populations, but I believe the latest estimate is around 2.2 million people. \\n\\nI should structure the JSON with a \"name\" field for the city, a \"population\" field, and a \"description\" for more details. Including a \"source\" field will add credibility by referencing a reliable statistic, maybe from the latest census or a recent report from the National Institute of Statistics.\\n\\nDouble-checking the population figure is important to ensure accuracy. I think I should confirm whether it\\'s the metropolitan area or the city proper. Paris with its arrondissements might have a slightly higher number, but population figures can vary based on definitions. \\n\\nWait, I think the population given is for the metropolitan area, not just the city limits. That makes sense because the city alone is a bit smaller. I\\'ll include both in the description to clarify.\\n\\nIs there any other information the user might need? Maybe the location or some interesting facts about Paris? I should keep it concise as they specifically asked for JSON, so probably the three fields I thought of are sufficient.\\n\\nDouble-checking the source will also help if they have a specific reference they prefer. It\\'s good practice to include that so the user knows where the information comes from.\\n\\nAlright, putting it all together in a JSON format with proper syntax. Make sure commas are correctly placed and there are no missing quotes. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. Time to format the response and provide it clearly.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2223740,\\n  \"description\": \"The capital of France, Paris, is a major city in northern-centralFrance.
