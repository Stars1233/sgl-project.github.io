    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '9e9a6bf686ea4955a5ecd691d0dc78a6', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.400402069091797}}</strong>"

Hmm, let me think about this. \\n\\nFirst off, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That part is straightforward. But I need to be sure. Let me just quickly verify that in my mind. Yep, Paris is definitely the capital.\\n\\nNow, the user specifically wants the population. Population data can be a bit tricky because it changes over time. I remember that recent estimates around 2023 put Paris\\'s population somewhere around 3.5 million. But it\\'s always fluctuating due to births, deaths, and migration. I should note that the number is approximate and might vary slightly depending on the source and the year.\\n\\nThey asked for this information in JSON format. JSON is a data interchange format that\\'s easy to read and write for humans and machines. I\\'ll need to structure it neatly with the country as a key and a value object that contains the city and population. \\n\\nI should make sure the JSON is valid, so proper syntax is crucial. The keys should be in quotes, and the values correctly assigned. Also, for the population number, including the placeholder notation (~) is a good idea to indicate that it\\'s an estimate and not an exact figure.\\n\\nPutting it all together, it\\'s important to present the information clearly and concisely. The user probably wants a straightforward response without any extra fluff, so keeping it simple and accurate is key. I\\'ll double-check the data to ensure it\\'s current and reliable. \\n\\nI think that\\'s everything. Time to format it properly in JSON.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": \"approximately 3.5 million\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 1077, 752, 1744, 911, 419, 13, 4710, 5338, 1007, 11, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 13, 2938, 949, 374, 30339, 13, 1988, 358, 1184, 311, 387, 2704, 13, 6771, 752, 1101, 6157, 10146, 429, 304, 847, 3971, 13, 84194, 11, 12095, 374, 8491, 279, 6722, 382, 7039, 11, 279, 1196, 11689, 6801, 279, 7042, 13, 39529, 821, 646, 387, 264, 2699, 33453, 1576, 432, 4344, 916, 882, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 3213, 17530, 2163, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 2182, 12095, 594, 7042, 14696, 2163, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 13, 1988, 432, 594, 2677, 38288, 53543, 4152, 311, 65232, 11, 16375, 11, 323, 11906, 13, 358, 1265, 5185, 429, 279, 1372, 374, 44868, 323, 2578, 13289, 10078, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 382, 6865, 4588, 369, 419, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 374, 264, 821, 51263, 3561, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 323, 3270, 369, 12677, 323, 12645, 13, 358, 3278, 1184, 311, 5944, 432, 62166, 448, 279, 3146, 438, 264, 1376, 323, 264, 897, 1633, 429, 5610, 279, 3283, 323, 7042, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 11, 773, 6169, 19482, 374, 16587, 13, 576, 6894, 1265, 387, 304, 17194, 11, 323, 279, 2750, 12440, 12607, 13, 7281, 11, 369, 279, 7042, 1372, 11, 2670, 279, 5878, 44197, 30757, 8, 374, 264, 1661, 4522, 311, 13216, 429, 432, 594, 458, 16045, 323, 537, 458, 4734, 7071, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 432, 594, 2989, 311, 3042, 279, 1995, 9355, 323, 3529, 285, 974, 13, 576, 1196, 4658, 6801, 264, 30339, 2033, 2041, 894, 4960, 1320, 1362, 11, 773, 10282, 432, 4285, 323, 13382, 374, 1376, 13, 358, 3278, 1990, 15934, 279, 821, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 1482, 323, 14720, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 4297, 13, 4120, 311, 3561, 432, 10277, 304, 4718, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 262, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 330, 96736, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 698, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '4d753ff5c8d64457b0c4211a3e72b325', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 390, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.658207893371582}}</strong>"
