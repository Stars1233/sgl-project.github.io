    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, the capital of France is definitely Paris. The population of Paris is a topic that\\'s often discussed, but I remember it can vary depending on how it\\'s counted. I think in recent years, it\\'s been around 12 million people. I should make sure to include the most accurate and up-to-date information. \\n\\nSo, I should structure the JSON with \"capital\" and \"population\". The capital is straightforward, it\\'s Paris. For the population, I\\'ll note that I\\'ve seen figures ranging a bit, so I\\'ll mention that the population figure is approximate and based on recent estimates, maybe around 12.5 million as of 2023. I want to ensure the user gets clear and precise information without unnecessary details. I\\'ll keep it simple and only include what\\'s necessary.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s needs, they might be looking for a quick data point for a project or report. Providing the information in JSON is a good idea because it\\'s easy to parse and use in various applications. I should make sure there are no typos or formatting errors in the JSON so it\\'s reliable. I\\'ll double-check the spelling of \"Paris\" and the number formatting in JSON because in JSON, commas are crucial and messing them up could cause errors. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. I\\'ll present the information clearly, ensuring everything is accurate and formatted correctly.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 12500000  // Approximately 12.5 million based on recent estimates\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 5889, 311, 279, 1196, 594, 1681, 13, 2379, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 8491, 12095, 13, 576, 7042, 315, 12095, 374, 264, 8544, 429, 594, 3545, 14078, 11, 714, 358, 6099, 432, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 1246, 432, 594, 29994, 13, 358, 1744, 304, 3213, 1635, 11, 432, 594, 1012, 2163, 220, 16, 17, 3526, 1251, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 279, 1429, 13382, 323, 705, 4686, 18413, 1995, 13, 4710, 4416, 11, 358, 1265, 5944, 279, 4718, 448, 330, 65063, 1, 323, 330, 44441, 3263, 576, 6722, 374, 30339, 11, 432, 594, 12095, 13, 1752, 279, 7042, 11, 358, 3278, 5185, 429, 358, 3003, 3884, 12396, 23994, 264, 2699, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 6286, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 374, 44868, 323, 3118, 389, 3213, 17530, 11, 7196, 2163, 220, 16, 17, 13, 20, 3526, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 358, 1366, 311, 5978, 279, 1196, 5221, 2797, 323, 23560, 1995, 2041, 25165, 3565, 13, 358, 3278, 2506, 432, 4285, 323, 1172, 2924, 1128, 594, 5871, 382, 13394, 11, 12831, 279, 1196, 594, 3880, 11, 807, 2578, 387, 3330, 369, 264, 3974, 821, 1459, 369, 264, 2390, 476, 1895, 13, 80100, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 374, 264, 1661, 4522, 1576, 432, 594, 4135, 311, 4715, 323, 990, 304, 5257, 8357, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 476, 36566, 5975, 304, 279, 4718, 773, 432, 594, 14720, 13, 358, 3278, 1990, 15934, 279, 42429, 315, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 279, 1372, 36566, 304, 4718, 1576, 304, 4718, 11, 76602, 525, 16587, 323, 75751, 1105, 705, 1410, 5240, 5975, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 1995, 9355, 11, 22573, 4297, 374, 13382, 323, 23126, 12440, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 16, 17, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 220, 442, 78804, 220, 16, 17, 13, 20, 3526, 3118, 389, 3213, 17530, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'd588e3eb16d047f6bd3acd8d662d45a2', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 358, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.670959711074829}}</strong>"
