    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out how to help the user get the information and population of France\\'s capital in JSON format. First, I should identify what the user is asking for. They mentioned the \"capital of France,\" which I know is Paris. But the user specifically asked for the population, so maybe they\\'re not sure which country it\\'s for or they might be asking about the population in general, not just in Paris. Hmm, though the context says the capital, so it\\'s likely referring to Paris.\\n\\nWait, no, the original question was about the capital\\'s population, but actually, the user said, \"Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.\" So they might actually have a slight misunderstanding and perhaps think of the country\\'s population, but likely they want the capital\\'s.\\n\\nI should make sure I understand correctly that they\\'re asking for Paris\\'s population, but maybe a small error in the question, thinking it\\'s France\\'s total population. I should assume they meant the capital\\'s population, so Paris.\\n\\nNext, I need to find accurate and recent data. As of 2023, Paris has a population of around 2.1 million. I should verify the sources to ensure this is up-to-date. Maybe check a recent census or official statistics from the French National Institute of Statistics and Mapping (INSEE).\\n\\nAlso, when formatting it in JSON, I need to present it properly. The user\\'s previous example used a \"data\" key containing a \"capital\" object with \"name\" and \"population\" properties. So I should follow that structure.\\n\\nI should structure the JSON like this: {\"capital\": {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2144000}}. Wait, earlier I thought it was around 2.1 million, but 2144000 is 2.144 million, which seems correct for 2023. Alternatively, some sources might say about 2.2 million, so perhaps 2102000? I need to make sure it\\'s accurate.\\n\\nAnother thought: should I include any other details, like the metropolitan area? But the user didn\\'t specify, so sticking to the city limits is probably best. Also, considering that sometimes population figures can vary slightly depending on the source or the year, but I\\'ll go with the most recent and commonly cited number.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, I\\'ll create a JSON object with the \"capital\" key containing \"name\" as \"Paris\" and \"population\" as 2144000. I\\'ll double-check this information to ensure it\\'s up-to-date and correct.\\n\\nWait, another angle: the user might be testing attention to detail, so perhaps I should note that the population figure provided is approximate and can change. But the main task is to provide the information, so maybe just presenting the number is sufficient, especially since it was specified as JSON.\\n\\nAlright, I think I\\'m ready to structure the response properly, making sure the data is accurate and presented in the correct JSON format as the user requested.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2144000\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 1492, 279, 1196, 633, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 9625, 594, 6722, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1265, 10542, 1128, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 13, 2379, 9733, 279, 330, 65063, 315, 9625, 1335, 892, 358, 1414, 374, 12095, 13, 1988, 279, 1196, 11689, 4588, 369, 279, 7042, 11, 773, 7196, 807, 2299, 537, 2704, 892, 3146, 432, 594, 369, 476, 807, 2578, 387, 10161, 911, 279, 7042, 304, 4586, 11, 537, 1101, 304, 12095, 13, 88190, 11, 3498, 279, 2266, 2727, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 432, 594, 4363, 22023, 311, 12095, 382, 14190, 11, 902, 11, 279, 4024, 3405, 572, 911, 279, 6722, 594, 7042, 11, 714, 3520, 11, 279, 1196, 1053, 11, 330, 35127, 752, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 279, 4718, 3561, 1189, 2055, 807, 2578, 3520, 614, 264, 8112, 69747, 323, 8365, 1744, 315, 279, 3146, 594, 7042, 11, 714, 4363, 807, 1366, 279, 6722, 594, 382, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 358, 3535, 12440, 429, 807, 2299, 10161, 369, 12095, 594, 7042, 11, 714, 7196, 264, 2613, 1465, 304, 279, 3405, 11, 7274, 432, 594, 9625, 594, 2790, 7042, 13, 358, 1265, 9658, 807, 8791, 279, 6722, 594, 7042, 11, 773, 12095, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 13382, 323, 3213, 821, 13, 1634, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 315, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 3526, 13, 358, 1265, 10146, 279, 8173, 311, 5978, 419, 374, 705, 4686, 18413, 13, 10696, 1779, 264, 3213, 43602, 476, 3946, 13142, 504, 279, 8585, 5055, 9976, 315, 24624, 323, 38446, 320, 687, 48740, 3593, 13394, 11, 979, 36566, 432, 304, 4718, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 3042, 432, 10277, 13, 576, 1196, 594, 3681, 3110, 1483, 264, 330, 691, 1, 1376, 8482, 264, 330, 65063, 1, 1633, 448, 330, 606, 1, 323, 330, 44441, 1, 5888, 13, 2055, 358, 1265, 1795, 429, 5944, 382, 40, 1265, 5944, 279, 4718, 1075, 419, 25, 5212, 65063, 788, 5212, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 19, 19, 15, 15, 15, 3417, 13, 13824, 11, 6788, 358, 3381, 432, 572, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 3526, 11, 714, 220, 17, 16, 19, 19, 15, 15, 15, 374, 220, 17, 13, 16, 19, 19, 3526, 11, 892, 4977, 4396, 369, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 38478, 11, 1045, 8173, 2578, 1977, 911, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 11, 773, 8365, 220, 17, 16, 15, 17, 15, 15, 15, 30, 358, 1184, 311, 1281, 2704, 432, 594, 13382, 382, 14037, 3381, 25, 1265, 358, 2924, 894, 1008, 3565, 11, 1075, 279, 57406, 3082, 30, 1988, 279, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 11, 773, 36972, 311, 279, 3283, 13388, 374, 4658, 1850, 13, 7281, 11, 12831, 429, 7025, 7042, 12396, 646, 13289, 10078, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 476, 279, 1042, 11, 714, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 323, 16626, 21870, 1372, 382, 4416, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 264, 4718, 1633, 448, 279, 330, 65063, 1, 1376, 8482, 330, 606, 1, 438, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 330, 44441, 1, 438, 220, 17, 16, 19, 19, 15, 15, 15, 13, 358, 3278, 1990, 15934, 419, 1995, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 705, 4686, 18413, 323, 4396, 382, 14190, 11, 2441, 9210, 25, 279, 1196, 2578, 387, 7497, 6529, 311, 7716, 11, 773, 8365, 358, 1265, 5185, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 3897, 374, 44868, 323, 646, 2297, 13, 1988, 279, 1887, 3383, 374, 311, 3410, 279, 1995, 11, 773, 7196, 1101, 31544, 279, 1372, 374, 14016, 11, 5310, 2474, 432, 572, 5189, 438, 4718, 382, 71486, 11, 358, 1744, 358, 2776, 5527, 311, 5944, 279, 2033, 10277, 11, 3259, 2704, 279, 821, 374, 13382, 323, 10449, 304, 279, 4396, 4718, 3561, 438, 279, 1196, 11223, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 262, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 19, 19, 15, 15, 15, 198, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'e905be95ae7c4d2395e2736c28ea29f1', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 676, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.217170000076294}}</strong>"

I should also consider whether to include any additional information, like the region or some interesting facts about the capital, but the user didn't mention that, so I'll stick to the basics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to get accurate and up-to-date information. The current population of Paris is something I can look up. As of 2023, I believe the population is around 2,100,000. I should double-check that to make sure it's correct. Let me see, yes, recent estimates put it around 2,158,300. Hmm, maybe I should use the most recent data to ensure accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, structuring the JSON. It should have a key-value pairs format. I'll probably have a top-level key like \"capital_info\" which contains a key-value pair where the key is \"name\" and the value is \"Paris\". Then another key \"country\" with the value \"France\". And a third key \"population\" with the number, maybe formatted with commas for readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about formatting. JSON requires that strings be enclosed in double quotes and that the data be properly indented for readability. So I'll make sure to format it neatly, maybe with proper indentation and line breaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to consider is whether the population figure should be an integer or a string. In JSON, numbers are typically represented without quotes, so I'll put it as a number. Also, including units like commas for thousands can make the number more understandable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about the possibility of the population changing over time. Since the user didn't specify a year, I'll assume it's the current population or perhaps the most recent estimate available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON structure would look something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital_info\": {\n",
      "    \"name\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "    \"country\": \"France\",\n",
      "    \"population\": 2158300\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user just asked for the capital and its population, so maybe I don't need the nested object. Perhaps it's simpler to have a flat structure. So, maybe just:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"country\": \"France\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 2158300\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "That might be cleaner and easier to read. I'll go with that structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure that the response is clear and concise, without any extra fluff. The user didn't mention any additional context or specific formatting beyond JSON, so sticking to the basics is probably best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I need to ensure that the JSON is valid. I can test it in a JSON validator if I have to, but given that it's straightforward, it should be fine.\n",
