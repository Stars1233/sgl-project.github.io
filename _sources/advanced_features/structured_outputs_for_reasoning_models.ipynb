    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '06309b2a0fe4495483b17bfcdf8e5312', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.435908317565918}}</strong>"

Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll recall that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s a given, but maybe I should verify it just to be sure. I know Paris is where the Eiffel Tower is located and it\\'s a major cultural and political center in France, so that makes sense.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember reading that major cities in France tend to have populations in the hundreds of thousands or even millions. I think the population probably ranges from around 2.2 million to 2.3 million. But I\\'m not entirely sure, I should check some sources to confirm this. However, since I\\'m just providing this information, I\\'ll go with 2,300,000 as the population. I think that\\'s the approximate figure that\\'s commonly cited.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON is a data interchange format that\\'s easy to read and write for people and machines. It uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll need to structure it that way. I\\'ll create a JSON object with a \"capital\" key and a \"population\" key, and assign the respective values to them.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key is in double quotes, and the values are numbers for the population. Also, the keys should be in lowercase letters. Putting it all together, the JSON would look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2300000}.\\n\\nI should double-check if there are any other details the user might want, like data sources, but the query only asks for the population, so I don\\'t need to include that. Just providing the JSON is sufficient.\\n\\nMaybe the user is a student working on a project or a project manager needing a quick data point. They might appreciate a straightforward response without extra fluff. So, keeping it concise and accurate is key.\\n\\nIn summary, Paris, being the capital, has a population around 2.3 million, and the JSON format ensures clarity and easy access for whatever application they might be using.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2300000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 5889, 311, 419, 3239, 1380, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 7042, 315, 9625, 594, 6722, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 3019, 553, 3019, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 3278, 19091, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 13, 2938, 594, 264, 2661, 11, 714, 7196, 358, 1265, 10146, 432, 1101, 311, 387, 2704, 13, 358, 1414, 12095, 374, 1380, 279, 468, 3092, 301, 21938, 374, 7407, 323, 432, 594, 264, 3598, 12752, 323, 4948, 4126, 304, 9625, 11, 773, 429, 3643, 5530, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 358, 6099, 5290, 429, 3598, 9720, 304, 9625, 8376, 311, 614, 21910, 304, 279, 11499, 315, 9037, 476, 1496, 11728, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 7042, 4658, 21283, 504, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 311, 220, 17, 13, 18, 3526, 13, 1988, 358, 2776, 537, 11368, 2704, 11, 358, 1265, 1779, 1045, 8173, 311, 7683, 419, 13, 4354, 11, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 8241, 419, 1995, 11, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 220, 17, 11, 18, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 1744, 429, 594, 279, 44868, 7071, 429, 594, 16626, 21870, 382, 7039, 11, 279, 1196, 6801, 419, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 374, 264, 821, 51263, 3561, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 323, 3270, 369, 1251, 323, 12645, 13, 1084, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1184, 311, 5944, 432, 429, 1616, 13, 358, 3278, 1855, 264, 4718, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 65063, 1, 1376, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 1376, 11, 323, 9793, 279, 19511, 2750, 311, 1105, 382, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 19482, 374, 4396, 13, 8886, 1376, 374, 304, 1990, 17194, 11, 323, 279, 2750, 525, 5109, 369, 279, 7042, 13, 7281, 11, 279, 6894, 1265, 387, 304, 42047, 11931, 13, 77890, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1035, 1401, 1075, 419, 25, 5212, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 18, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 382, 40, 1265, 1990, 15934, 421, 1052, 525, 894, 1008, 3565, 279, 1196, 2578, 1366, 11, 1075, 821, 8173, 11, 714, 279, 3239, 1172, 17064, 369, 279, 7042, 11, 773, 358, 1513, 944, 1184, 311, 2924, 429, 13, 4599, 8241, 279, 4718, 374, 14016, 382, 21390, 279, 1196, 374, 264, 5458, 3238, 389, 264, 2390, 476, 264, 2390, 6645, 32821, 264, 3974, 821, 1459, 13, 2379, 2578, 15401, 264, 30339, 2033, 2041, 4960, 1320, 1362, 13, 2055, 11, 10282, 432, 63594, 323, 13382, 374, 1376, 382, 641, 12126, 11, 12095, 11, 1660, 279, 6722, 11, 702, 264, 7042, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 18, 3526, 11, 323, 279, 4718, 3561, 25351, 31273, 323, 4135, 2615, 369, 8820, 3766, 807, 2578, 387, 1667, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 18, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '60cb278c933d4467aa0ef3514dc63679', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 494, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.193932294845581}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I need to figure out what the capital of France is. I'm pretty sure it's Paris, but I should double-check that to be sure. Maybe I can recall or think about some other capitals I know, like London for the UK, Beijing for China, etc. Yeah, Paris definitely rings a bell as the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the population part. I don't remember the exact number, but I know it's a major city with a large population. I think it's in the hundreds of millions. Maybe around 100 million? Wait, I've heard it referred to as 100-something million. I should check that. Perhaps it's 106 million or something close. I'll go with 106,147,000 as the approximate figure, but I need to make sure that's up to date. Population numbers change every year, so it's good to note that it's an approximate value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, structuring this into JSON. The user wants it in JSON format, so I should create an object with the key \"capital\" that contains another object with \"name\" and \"population\". The population should be a number, and the name of the city should be a string. So, it'll look like {\"capital\": {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 106147000}}.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also mention that the population is approximate because it's important to be clear about that. Maybe adding a note like \"(approximately)\" at the end. That way, the user knows there might be slight variations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should be straightforward. I need to ensure the syntax is correct, with commas in the right places and proper quotation marks. I don't want any syntax errors because that could cause issues later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to recap: identify the capital, get the population number, structure it in JSON, and include a note about the approximation. I think that covers everything the user asked for. They probably need this information for a project or a presentation, so accuracy is key, but acknowledging that it's an estimate is also good practice.\n",

They might follow up with more questions if needed, but for now, providing the JSON with the necessary details should suffice.\n",
