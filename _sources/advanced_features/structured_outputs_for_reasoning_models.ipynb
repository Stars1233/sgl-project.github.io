    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is in New York and they want to know the current date and time as well as the weather. Let me break this down. They mentioned two separate pieces of information: date and time, and weather. I need to figure out how to get both using the functions they provided.<br><br>First, they're in New York, so the timezone for the date and time should be 'America/New_York'. That makes sense because New York is in that timezone. So I'll use the get_current_date function with the timezone parameter set to 'America/New_York'. That should give me the current date and time for them.<br><br>Next, for the weather, the user didn't specify a city or state, but since they're in New York, I can assume they're asking about their location. So I'll use the get_current_weather function. But wait, I need to check the function's parameters. It requires 'city' and 'state' as strings, plus 'unit' for temperature. Since the user is in New York, I'll use 'New York' as the city and 'NY' as the state. For the unit, I should probably default to Fahrenheit since that's a common request, but maybe include Celsius just in case. Alternatively, I can check if the user prefers one, but since it's not specified, I'll include both options or default to Fahrenheit.<br><br>Wait, no, the user didn't specify the unit, so it's safer to include both possibilities. But looking at the function's description, it allows the unit to be either 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit', so I can set it to 'fahrenheit' by default but mention that Celsius is also available. Alternatively, I can call the function with unit set to 'fahrenheit' and mention that if they prefer Celsius, they can specify.<br><br>So putting it all together, I'll first call get_current_date with timezone 'America/New_York' and then get_current_weather with city 'New York', state 'NY', and unit 'fahrenheit'. Then, I'll present both pieces of information to the user, making sure to include the sources from the functions.<br><br>Wait, but the user didn't specify the timezone for the date and time. They just said \"the current date and time\", so I should use the user's current location's timezone. But in this case, since they're in New York, it's 'America/New_York', so I can proceed with that.<br><br>I think that's all. I'll structure the response by first calling get_current_date and then get_current_weather, providing the parameters as JSON objects, and then presenting the results to the user.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user asked for the capital of France\\'s population in a specific format. I need to figure out what they\\'re really after here. They probably want a straightforward piece of information. \\n\\nFirst, the capital of France is definitely Paris, so that\\'s pretty basic. But now, they want the population. Population numbers can be tricky because they change every year, and different sources might have slightly different figures. I should check the latest available data to provide the most accurate answer.\\n\\nI know that Paris has been growing a bit, but I\\'m not sure how recent the population figure is. Maybe the latest data is from 2021, but I should double-check. Also, it\\'s important to note that this is an estimate unless the user is looking for historical data.\\n\\nI should also consider why they want this information. Maybe they\\'re working on a project, writing a report, or just curious. Either way, providing the population in the JSON format makes sense. JSON is a common data format, so it\\'s likely acceptable for whatever they\\'re using it for.\\n\\nI think 9 million is a commonly cited number, but I want to make sure. Let me see, yes, in 2021, Paris had a population around 9 million people, though it\\'s estimated between 8.9 and nearly 10 million. So I\\'ll go with 9 million for simplicity unless they specify otherwise.\\n\\nNow, about the structure of the response. They mentioned JSON format, so I\\'ll make sure the information is within a proper JSON structure. It\\'s better to give a clear key-value pair for clarity. So the key would be \"capital\" or wait, the user previously asked about the capital, so they might already know it\\'s Paris. But they want the population. Hmm, maybe they wanted both the capital and the population? Let me read the query again.\\n\\nWait, the user wrote: \"Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.\" So they want the population of Paris, which is the capital. So in the JSON, I should have a key like \"population\" with the value 9 million, and maybe another key for the capital itself if needed, but since they already know it\\'s Paris, perhaps just the population. Alternatively, maybe include both in case they need more info. But since the capital is given, perhaps just the population is sufficient.\\n\\nI\\'m a bit confused whether they want the capital in the JSON or not, but the way the question is phrased, they might be implying that they need both the capital and the population. So I\\'ll structure the JSON to include both the capital and the population for completeness.\\n\\nWait, looking at the initial example I gave, it included a \"capital\" key with the value \"Paris\" and a \"population\" key with the value 9000000. So I\\'ll stick with that structure. Maybe it\\'s better to present it clearly with both pieces of information in a JSON object.\\n\\nI should also make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotes. No trailing commas to avoid errors. So the JSON should look clean and be properly formatted.\\n\\nIn summary, the response should provide Paris as the capital and 9 million as the population in a JSON structure.
