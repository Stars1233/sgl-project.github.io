    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the current date and time in New York and the weather there using the functions provided. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I know that the user is asking for two things: the current date and time in New York and the weather in New York. I have two functions available for this: get_current_date and get_current_weather. Each has its own set of parameters.<br><br>Starting with the date and time. The function get_current_date requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone. So I'll structure the function call as <function=get_current_date '{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}'}. That should give me the current date and time in New York.<br><br>Next, for the weather. The function get_current_weather needs a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, but I need the state abbreviation. New York's state is NY, so the state parameter is 'NY'. The unit should be Fahrenheit since the user is asking for the temperature in Fahrenheit. So the parameters for this function call would be {'city': 'New York', 'state': 'NY', 'unit': 'fahrenheit'}. Therefore, the function call would be <function=get_current_weather '{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}'}. <br><br>I should make sure to include both function calls in the same message, each on their own line, following the specified format. Also, I need to remember to add the sources where I got the function definitions from, which in this case is the provided JSON info about the functions.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll send two separate function calls, each properly formatted with their respective parameters. That should fulfill the user's request accurately.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\":\"America/New_York\"}</function><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\":\"New_York\",\"state\":\"NY\",\"unit\":\"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'e53218cab7cb413b9687697d145ae94d', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.5743677616119385}}</strong>"

Hmm, I need to figure out what exactly they want. Capital of France is Paris, right? So they probably want the population data, maybe recent stats.\\n\\nFirst, I should confirm the current population of Paris. I know it\\'s a major city, so it\\'s going to have a substantial population. I recall reading that it\\'s over 3 million, but let me double-check the exact figure. According to recent data, Paris has a population of around 3,507,797 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\\n\\nWait, but the user didn\\'t specify the source. It\\'s always good to mention that populations can vary based on the source—like government reports, censuses, or estimates. They might be looking for reliable information, so including the note is helpful.\\n\\nNow, about the format. They wanted JSON, so I should structure the information neatly. The main points are the capital\\'s name, the city name, region, population, and population growth rate. I should include a summary as a concluding sentence to make it clear and concise.\\n\\nI also wonder why someone would need this information. Maybe for a project, a school assignment, or just general knowledge. Since they asked for JSON, perhaps they\\'ll be using it for a program or another application. Including the growth rate is useful if they\\'re analyzing trends over time.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON is properly formatted with correct syntax—everything in quotes where needed, commas in the right places. It should be easy to copy and use without issues. Let me check that.\\n\\nOh, and I should keep the language simple and clear. No need for any fancy formatting beyond what\\'s necessary for JSON compatibility. Once I put all that together, I can present it to the user. They should be satisfied with the accurate, well-structured information with a brief explanation.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"country\": \"France\",\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"region\": \"Ile-de-France\",\\n    \"population\": 3507797,\\n    \"population_growth_rate\": \"1.3%\"\\n  },\\n  \"summary\": \"Paris is the capital city of France with a population of approximately 3,507,797 people as of 2023.\"\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 4588, 752, 311, 3410, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1128, 6896, 807, 1366, 13, 18374, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 11, 1290, 30, 2055, 807, 4658, 1366, 279, 7042, 821, 11, 7196, 3213, 10472, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1265, 7683, 279, 1482, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 358, 1414, 432, 594, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 432, 594, 2087, 311, 614, 264, 11924, 7042, 13, 358, 19091, 5290, 429, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 1077, 752, 1990, 15934, 279, 4734, 7071, 13, 10548, 311, 3213, 821, 11, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 315, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 22, 11, 22, 24, 22, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 382, 14190, 11, 714, 279, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 279, 2530, 13, 1084, 594, 2677, 1661, 311, 6286, 429, 21910, 646, 13289, 3118, 389, 279, 2530, 2293, 4803, 3033, 6682, 11, 272, 724, 4776, 11, 476, 17530, 13, 2379, 2578, 387, 3330, 369, 14720, 1995, 11, 773, 2670, 279, 5185, 374, 10950, 382, 7039, 11, 911, 279, 3561, 13, 2379, 4829, 4718, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 5944, 279, 1995, 62166, 13, 576, 1887, 3501, 525, 279, 6722, 594, 829, 11, 279, 3283, 829, 11, 5537, 11, 7042, 11, 323, 7042, 6513, 4379, 13, 358, 1265, 2924, 264, 12126, 438, 264, 71026, 11652, 311, 1281, 432, 2797, 323, 63594, 382, 40, 1083, 5775, 3170, 4325, 1035, 1184, 419, 1995, 13, 10696, 369, 264, 2390, 11, 264, 2906, 16319, 11, 476, 1101, 4586, 6540, 13, 8704, 807, 4588, 369, 4718, 11, 8365, 807, 3278, 387, 1667, 432, 369, 264, 2025, 476, 2441, 3766, 13, 55121, 279, 6513, 4379, 374, 5390, 421, 807, 2299, 41018, 18339, 916, 882, 382, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 374, 10277, 23126, 448, 4396, 19482, 2293, 72726, 304, 17194, 1380, 4362, 11, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 1084, 1265, 387, 4135, 311, 2975, 323, 990, 2041, 4714, 13, 6771, 752, 1779, 429, 382, 11908, 11, 323, 358, 1265, 2506, 279, 4128, 4285, 323, 2797, 13, 2308, 1184, 369, 894, 26457, 36566, 7797, 1128, 594, 5871, 369, 4718, 24748, 13, 9646, 358, 2182, 678, 429, 3786, 11, 358, 646, 3042, 432, 311, 279, 1196, 13, 2379, 1265, 387, 19527, 448, 279, 13382, 11, 1632, 12, 51143, 1995, 448, 264, 9814, 16148, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 262, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 262, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 3943, 788, 330, 40, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 756, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 22, 22, 24, 22, 345, 262, 330, 44441, 49182, 9246, 788, 330, 16, 13, 18, 63861, 220, 1153, 220, 330, 1708, 788, 330, 59604, 374, 279, 6722, 3283, 315, 9625, 448, 264, 7042, 315, 13187, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 22, 11, 22, 24, 22, 1251, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 10040, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '056e219794a54921970ad3f179058694', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 519, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.2781379222869873}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to find the information and population of the capital of France. Let me think through this step by step. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's a fact I've heard before, but I should make sure I'm not confusing it with another country's capital. I remember that London is the capital of the UK, Berlin is Germany's, and Tokyo is Japan's. Yeah, so Paris must be correct for France.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to find the population of Paris. I think I've seen numbers somewhere around 2 million, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a bit more or less. I recall that major cities in France, like Lyon or Marseille, have populations in the hundreds of thousands, but Paris is definitely the largest. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder where this population number comes from. Is it from the latest census? Or maybe an estimate based on city growth? I should check if there's a reliable source. Maybe the official website of the Parisian government or a recent report from the national statistics office in France. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think I've heard that the population is around 2.1 million as of the latest estimates. That sounds familiar. I'm going to go with that number for now, but I should note that it's an approximate figure and could change over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together, the capital is Paris, and its population is approximately 2.1 million. I need to present this information in JSON format, which is a way to structure data. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's commonly used for transmitting data in web applications. \n",
      "\n",
      "In JSON, I can represent this as an object with a key \"capital\" and its value as \"Paris\", another key \"population\" with the value 2100000. That should be clear and concise. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with commas and quotation marks in the right places to avoid any errors when it's parsed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also double-check the population number to ensure accuracy. Maybe I can recall that in recent years, the population has been growing slowly. So 2.1 million seems reasonable. Alternatively, I can think about the population density of Paris, which is very high, so a slightly smaller area can accommodate a large population. That makes sense because Paris is an urban agglomeration that includes neighboring suburbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there any other information that might be required? The user only asked for the capital and its population, so I think I've covered everything. I don't need to include any additional fields unless specified.\n",
