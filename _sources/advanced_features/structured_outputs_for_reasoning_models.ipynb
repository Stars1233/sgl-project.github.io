    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets.

Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I need to figure out how to get the current date and time. I remember that the function for that is get_current_date. It requires a timezone parameter. The user mentioned New York, so I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone.<br><br>Next, the weather part. The function for that is get_current_weather, which needs a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, but I should check the state abbreviation. New York is NY, so the state is 'NY'. The unit should probably be Fahrenheit since the default might be Celsius, but it's not specified. I'll include 'fahrenheit' as the unit.<br><br>Now, I need to structure the response correctly. The user mentioned putting the entire function call on one line, so I'll format it as <function=...> with the parameters inside. I'll separate the date and weather function calls with line breaks for clarity.<br><br>I should also make sure to include the source links for both functions in the response. For get_current_date, the source is https://docsbrave.com/api-functions/#get_current_date, and for get_current_weather, it's https://docsbrave.com/api-functions/#get_current_weather.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write the date function first, then a line break, followed by the weather function with all the required parameters.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

So my first step is to confirm that. \\n\\nNext, I need to remember or look up the population of Paris. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Wait, no, I recall that Paris has a metropolitan area population exceeding 12 million, but the city proper is about 2.1 million. \\n\\nI also need to include other relevant details like the country it\\'s in, which is France, the administrative region, and maybe the timezone. These details make the JSON more informative and accurate.\\n\\nThinking about the user\\'s intent, they likely want a concise data structure for easy access. JSON is perfect for that, so I\\'ll format it neatly with proper syntax. Making sure all keys are correct and values are accurate is crucial here.\\n\\nI should structure the JSON with a main key like \"information\" that contains a nested \"population\" key. This keeps it organized. No markdown, just plain JSON. \\n\\nDouble-checking each piece of information to ensure accuracy is important. Population numbers can fluctuate, but 2,154,316 is a commonly cited figure as of recently. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should be clear and ready for the user to use as needed. Avoiding any unnecessary complexity ensures it\\'s user-friendly.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"country\": \"France\",\\n    \"administrativeRegion\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2154316,\\n    \"timezone\": \"UTC+1 (Effective from 2020-01-01)\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 358, 7069, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 374, 12095, 13, 2055, 847, 1156, 3019, 374, 311, 7683, 429, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 6099, 476, 1401, 705, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 13824, 11, 902, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 12095, 702, 264, 57406, 3082, 7042, 47905, 220, 16, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 279, 3283, 6169, 374, 911, 220, 17, 13, 16, 3526, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 2924, 1008, 9760, 3565, 1075, 279, 3146, 432, 594, 304, 11, 892, 374, 9625, 11, 279, 22707, 5537, 11, 323, 7196, 279, 33957, 13, 4220, 3565, 1281, 279, 4718, 803, 38219, 323, 13382, 382, 93945, 911, 279, 1196, 594, 7385, 11, 807, 4363, 1366, 264, 63594, 821, 5944, 369, 4135, 2615, 13, 4718, 374, 4727, 369, 429, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 3561, 432, 62166, 448, 6169, 19482, 13, 24288, 2704, 678, 6894, 525, 4396, 323, 2750, 525, 13382, 374, 16587, 1588, 382, 40, 1265, 5944, 279, 4718, 448, 264, 1887, 1376, 1075, 330, 25069, 1, 429, 5610, 264, 24034, 330, 44441, 1, 1376, 13, 1096, 13598, 432, 16645, 13, 2308, 50494, 11, 1101, 14396, 4718, 13, 4710, 7378, 15934, 287, 1817, 6573, 315, 1995, 311, 5978, 13403, 374, 2989, 13, 39529, 5109, 646, 38288, 6292, 11, 714, 220, 17, 11, 16, 20, 19, 11, 18, 16, 21, 374, 264, 16626, 21870, 7071, 438, 315, 5926, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 387, 2797, 323, 5527, 369, 279, 1196, 311, 990, 438, 4362, 13, 34006, 287, 894, 25165, 23094, 25351, 432, 594, 1196, 21896, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 262, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 262, 330, 68849, 1388, 14091, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 19, 18, 16, 21, 345, 262, 330, 43271, 788, 330, 21183, 10, 16, 320, 67539, 504, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 12, 15, 16, 12, 15, 16, 12954, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '510e0cfdc6aa45b88baab0faef2fd65c', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 378, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.9043641090393066}}</strong>"
