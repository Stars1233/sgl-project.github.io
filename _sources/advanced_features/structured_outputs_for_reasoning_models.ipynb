    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '99f75266bce843c9b4dba45c4e6aec34', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.5505259037017822}}</strong>"

Hmm, the capital of France is definitely Paris. Got that. I need to recall or look up the population. I know that Paris has grown a lot over the years, but I\\'m not exactly sure about the current figure. Let me think, the last few estimates I remember were around 3 million people. But wait, that seems a bit low now.\\n\\nOh, right, every year the city gains population due to people moving in for work, studies, and services. So, maybe the population is a bit higher now. Let me check a reliable source. A quick search shows that as of 2023, Paris has a population of approximately 3.5 million. That makes more sense because I\\'ve seen that number mentioned in recent news about urban development and population growth.\\n\\nOkay, so putting that together, the JSON structure should have the key \"city\" as \"Paris\" and the key \"population\" as 3500000. That format is standard for JSON, so it should work well for whatever the user needs it for, like maybe integrating it into an app or a report. I think providing that number is accurate enough for general purposes. I should also mention that for the most current data, they can cross-check with the latest census or government reports to get the exact figure.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 8491, 12095, 13, 24528, 429, 13, 358, 1184, 311, 19091, 476, 1401, 705, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 702, 14700, 264, 2696, 916, 279, 1635, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 911, 279, 1482, 7071, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 11, 279, 1537, 2421, 17530, 358, 6099, 1033, 2163, 220, 18, 3526, 1251, 13, 1988, 3783, 11, 429, 4977, 264, 2699, 3347, 1431, 382, 11908, 11, 1290, 11, 1449, 1042, 279, 3283, 19619, 7042, 4152, 311, 1251, 7218, 304, 369, 975, 11, 7822, 11, 323, 3516, 13, 2055, 11, 7196, 279, 7042, 374, 264, 2699, 5080, 1431, 13, 6771, 752, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 13, 362, 3974, 2711, 4933, 429, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 315, 13187, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 13, 2938, 3643, 803, 5530, 1576, 358, 3003, 3884, 429, 1372, 9733, 304, 3213, 3669, 911, 15662, 4401, 323, 7042, 6513, 382, 32313, 11, 773, 10687, 429, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 5944, 1265, 614, 279, 1376, 330, 8926, 1, 438, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 279, 1376, 330, 44441, 1, 438, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 3561, 374, 5297, 369, 4718, 11, 773, 432, 1265, 975, 1632, 369, 8820, 279, 1196, 3880, 432, 369, 11, 1075, 7196, 53852, 432, 1119, 458, 906, 476, 264, 1895, 13, 358, 1744, 8241, 429, 1372, 374, 13382, 3322, 369, 4586, 9895, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 6286, 429, 369, 279, 1429, 1482, 821, 11, 807, 646, 5312, 15934, 448, 279, 5535, 43602, 476, 3033, 6682, 311, 633, 279, 4734, 7071, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '42160905f9f349c19e6dc87eee914a29', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 335, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.0945165157318115}}</strong>"

      "\n",
      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty straightforward, but I should double-check to make sure. Maybe I'll think about the list of French capitals—I remember that Paris is definitely the one. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to find the population of Paris. I'm not exactly sure of the exact number, but I remember it's a big city with millions of people. I think it's around 2 million. Wait, no, isn't it more than that? Maybe around 2.1 million? I'm not entirely certain, but I'll go with that for now.\n",

      "I think that's correct. But just to be safe, I should make sure I'm using the right syntax. Commas are important in JSON, and each key should have a corresponding value without any trailing commas that could cause errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in this case, since there are only two key-value pairs, the JSON is straightforward. No need for more complex structures. \n",
