    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'bda912b47f1b4142a461d3fa2e21f9c9', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 4.685766696929932}}\n"

Hmm, first, I need to figure out what exactly they\\'re asking for. I know that the capital of France is Paris, so that\\'s a given. \\n\\nNow, I should gather accurate data about Paris\\'s population. I remember that population numbers can change over time, so I need to check the most recent data available. I think the last census was around 2020, which might be the most up-to-date figure. \\n\\nWait, I also need to consider if the user might be looking for something specific, like the exact number or maybe when it was officially counted. Oh, I should also think about formatting this information in JSON. JSON is a common data format, so it\\'s a good choice for structure. \\n\\nI should make sure the JSON structure is correct, probably an object with keys like \"city\" for name, \"country\" for context, and \"population\" for the number. Maybe also include when the population was measured to add more details. \\n\\nI\\'m not entirely sure about the exact number, but I believe it\\'s around 2.2 million. Let me double-check that. Yes, in 2021, Paris had a population of approximately 2,217,342. That seems right. \\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON should have a \"name\" field, a \"city\" field with the name, a \"country\" field pointing back to France, and a \"population\" key with the number, along with a note about the year it was measured. That way, the user gets the latest and accurate information in a structured format. I should present it clearly and make sure the syntax is correct to avoid any errors when they use the JSON.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"city\": \"Paris, Île-de-France, France\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"population\": 2217342,\\n  \"year\": 2021\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 4588, 752, 311, 3410, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 1156, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1128, 6896, 807, 2299, 10161, 369, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 11, 773, 429, 594, 264, 2661, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1265, 9567, 13382, 821, 911, 12095, 594, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 7042, 5109, 646, 2297, 916, 882, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 1779, 279, 1429, 3213, 821, 2500, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 1537, 43602, 572, 2163, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 11, 892, 2578, 387, 279, 1429, 705, 4686, 18413, 7071, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 1083, 1184, 311, 2908, 421, 279, 1196, 2578, 387, 3330, 369, 2494, 3151, 11, 1075, 279, 4734, 1372, 476, 7196, 979, 432, 572, 18562, 29994, 13, 8670, 11, 358, 1265, 1083, 1744, 911, 36566, 419, 1995, 304, 4718, 13, 4718, 374, 264, 4185, 821, 3561, 11, 773, 432, 594, 264, 1661, 5754, 369, 5944, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 5944, 374, 4396, 11, 4658, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 1, 369, 829, 11, 330, 11141, 1, 369, 2266, 11, 323, 330, 44441, 1, 369, 279, 1372, 13, 10696, 1083, 2924, 979, 279, 7042, 572, 16878, 311, 912, 803, 3565, 13, 4710, 40, 2776, 537, 11368, 2704, 911, 279, 4734, 1372, 11, 714, 358, 4411, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 13, 6771, 752, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 7414, 11, 304, 220, 17, 15, 17, 16, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 17, 16, 22, 11, 18, 19, 17, 13, 2938, 4977, 1290, 13, 4710, 4416, 11, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 614, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 11, 264, 330, 8926, 1, 2070, 448, 279, 829, 11, 264, 330, 11141, 1, 2070, 21633, 1182, 311, 9625, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 1376, 448, 279, 1372, 11, 3156, 448, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 1042, 432, 572, 16878, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 279, 1196, 5221, 279, 5535, 323, 13382, 1995, 304, 264, 32930, 3561, 13, 358, 1265, 3042, 432, 9355, 323, 1281, 2704, 279, 19482, 374, 4396, 311, 5648, 894, 5975, 979, 807, 990, 279, 4718, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 11, 59108, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 11, 9625, 756, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 17, 16, 22, 18, 19, 17, 345, 220, 330, 3157, 788, 220, 17, 15, 17, 16, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '0fcddb0be2c540f18a810de68a06a82e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 451, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.2931058406829834}}</strong>"
