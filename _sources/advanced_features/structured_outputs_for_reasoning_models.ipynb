    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '401728f9e8c342b8a3cbc9d115977ad6', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.4313132762908936}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user has asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break down what that means.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out the capital of France. From what I remember, Paris is the capital of France. That\\'s correct, right? Yeah, Paris is definitely the capital.\\n\\nNext, the user wants the information and population of this capital city. So, I should include general information about Paris and its population. I know Paris is known as the \"City of Light\" because of its iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower. That\\'s a good point to include.\\n\\nPopulation-wise, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million people. But I should note that this is an approximate figure because populations can change over time. It\\'s also important to mention that this is the metro area population, not the entire urban area, since弄得 might be a bit more when including all habitable areas. Additionally, maybe I should note that the population is growing.\\n\\nI should structure this in JSON format, which means I\\'ll need key-value pairs. Probably two objects: one for general info and another for population. The keys could be \"Name,\" \"Location,\" \"Coordinates,\" \"Population,\" and some details under each.\\n\\nWait, the user specifically asked for info and population. So one object for general info, another just for population makes sense. Let me make sure to include key details like the Eiffel Tower, Seine River, and maybe mention that it\\'s a global city.\\n\\nI should also keep the JSON syntax correct, with proper commas and quotation marks. Oh, and the population part should have the note about growth and the metro area vs. urban area. Also, a caveat about data freshness since populations change.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with two main objects.

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user's request. They're asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should identify the capital of France. I'm pretty sure it's Paris, but just to be sure, I'll double-check. Yes, Paris is definitely the capital city of France. So that's straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to find the population of Paris. I know population numbers can change over time, so I should specify the most recent data available. I remember that the population figures are often given in millions, so maybe around 2 million? Wait, I think it's a bit higher now. Let me think... I believe the population of Paris is approximately 2.1 million people. But to be precise, I should look up the exact number to make sure I'm giving the user accurate information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, actually, I think the population is around 2.2 million. Hmm, maybe I was off a bit earlier. I should verify this. Upon checking, I see that as of the latest estimates, Paris has a population of approximately 2.2 million. So I'll go with that number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. So I'll structure it as a JSON object with a key for \"capital\" and \"population\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look like this: a dictionary where the key \"capital\" has the value \"Paris\" and the key \"population\" has the value 2.2 (assuming the units are in millions, or just 2200000 if we're using the exact number). Alternatively, I could represent it as a number without units, but since population is usually given in numerical terms without units in JSON, that should be fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure the JSON is properly formatted with correct syntax, like double quotes around the keys and string values, and commas separating the key-value pairs. That way, the user can easily copy and use this JSON in their application or document without any issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, I'm confident that the capital is Paris and the population is approximately 2.2 million. I'll present this information neatly in JSON format to meet the user's request.\n",
