    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out how to get both the current date and time in New York and the weather there using the functions provided. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I know that the user is in New York, so they want the local time. But wait, the user mentioned they are in New York, but they didn't specify the timezone. I think I should clarify this. Maybe I should check if the current date and time are already in New York's timezone. Or perhaps the user is asking for the date and time in their local timezone, which might be different if they're not in New York. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.<br><br>Looking at the functions available, there's 'get_current_date' which requires a timezone parameter. So if I want to get the current date and time in New York, I should provide the timezone as 'America/New_York'. That makes sense. I'll call 'get_current_date' with the timezone set to 'America/New_York'.<br><br>Next, for the weather. The user is in New York, so I need the current weather in that location. The function 'get_current_weather' requires a city and a state, along with the unit for temperature. I know that New York is a city, but I'm not sure about the state code. I think it's 'NY' because New York State is NY. So I'll provide 'city' as 'New York' and 'state' as 'NY'. Also, the user didn't specify the unit, so I should default to Fahrenheit since that's common in the US. Alternatively, I could include both options, but maybe Fahrenheit is safer unless they specify Celsius.<br><br>Putting it all together, I need to make two separate function calls. First, 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter. Second, 'get_current_weather' with city, state, and unit parameters. I should structure each function call separately, as per the instructions, making sure each has the required parameters in the correct format.<br><br>Wait, but can I combine them into one function call? No, because each function has different parameters. So I have to call them separately. That means I'll send two separate messages, each starting with the function name and their respective parameters.<br><br>Also, I should remember to include the sources in the response. For the date and time, it's from the 'get_current_date' function. For the weather, it's from 'get_current_weather'. So I'll mention that the data is sourced from these functions.<br><br>I'm a bit unsure about the timezone part. What if the user isn't in New York? But the user specifically said they are in New York, so I think it's safe to proceed with that timezone.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the date and time functions are affected by daylight saving time. But since the functions likely handle that internally, I don't need to worry about it.<br><br>So, to summarize, I'll first call 'get_current_date' with 'America/New_York' as the timezone. Then, I'll call 'get_current_weather' with 'New York' as the city, 'NY' as the state, and 'fahrenheit' as the unit. Each call will be on a separate line with the appropriate parameters.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\":\"America/New_York\"}</function><br><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\":\"New York\",\"state\":\"NY\",\"unit\":\"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

Hmm, okay, first things first, I need to figure out what the capital of France is. I remember that Paris is the capital, right? Yeah, that\\'s correct. Now, I need to find the population of Paris. \\n\\nWait, populations can change over time, so I should make sure the number I provide is current. I think the population of Paris is around 2 million, but I\\'m not 100% sure. Let me double-check that. Okay, sources say it\\'s approximately 2,177,766 as of 2023. That sounds about right. \\n\\nNow, the user wants this in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, so I need to structure it as an object with a key-value pair. The key should be \"capital\" and the value should be an object containing \"name\" and \"population\". \\n\\nWait, in the initial response, the \"capital\" key was set to \"Paris\", which is correct. So, the structure would look like {\"capital\": {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2177766}}. I should present it clearly, maybe with proper formatting, so it\\'s easy to read.\\n\\nI should also make sure to use the correct syntax with commas and colons. Oh, and the population number should be accurate. Let me verify once more. Yes, 2,177,766 is correct for Paris\\'s population. \\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should accurately reflect the capital\\'s name and the latest population figure.
