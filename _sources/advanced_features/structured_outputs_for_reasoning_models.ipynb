    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

I need to figure out how to get this information using the functions provided. <br><br>First, for the date and time, the function is get_current_date. It requires a timezone parameter. The user mentioned New York, so I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone. <br><br>Next, the weather information. The available function is get_current_weather, which needs city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state would be 'NY' since New York is NY, and the unit is probably Fahrenheit since that's a common request, but I should check if the user specified. Since they didn't, I'll assume Fahrenheit.<br><br>I should structure the response by calling each function separately.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '6e1507f58aa844ee9f735dc82101a811', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.481724977493286}}</strong>"

The question is asking for information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let\\'s break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I should identify the capital city of France. I know that Paris is the capital. Got that.\\n\\nNext, I need to recall or look up the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population. I think the population is in the mid-300,000s. Let me check the numbers. Oh, right, as of recent estimates, Paris has a population around 3,630,000. But I should make sure this is up-to-date. Maybe the number has changed recently? Well, unless the user provided current data, it\\'s best to use the most recent figure I have.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON structure usually has key-value pairs. So I should structure it with keys like \"city\", \"population\". That makes sense.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll create a JSON object with the city as \"Paris\" and the population as 3630000. I\\'ll make sure the numbers are accurate and the format is correct.\\n\\nWait, should I include any units? Probably not necessary here since population numbers are usually just the number. So 3630000 would suffice.\\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the JSON with these two pieces of information. They didn\\'t mention anything else, so this should cover it.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3630000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 5889, 311, 419, 1196, 3239, 13, 576, 3405, 374, 10161, 369, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 1077, 594, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1265, 10542, 279, 6722, 3283, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 13, 24528, 429, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 19091, 476, 1401, 705, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 448, 264, 3460, 7042, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 7042, 374, 304, 279, 5099, 12, 18, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 82, 13, 6771, 752, 1779, 279, 5109, 13, 8670, 11, 1290, 11, 438, 315, 3213, 17530, 11, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 21, 18, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 13, 1988, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 419, 374, 705, 4686, 18413, 13, 10696, 279, 1372, 702, 5497, 5926, 30, 8325, 11, 7241, 279, 1196, 3897, 1482, 821, 11, 432, 594, 1850, 311, 990, 279, 1429, 3213, 7071, 358, 614, 382, 7039, 11, 279, 1196, 6801, 419, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 5944, 5990, 702, 1376, 19083, 13530, 13, 2055, 358, 1265, 5944, 432, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 3263, 2938, 3643, 5530, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 264, 4718, 1633, 448, 279, 3283, 438, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 279, 7042, 438, 220, 18, 21, 18, 15, 15, 15, 15, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 279, 5109, 525, 13382, 323, 279, 3561, 374, 4396, 382, 14190, 11, 1265, 358, 2924, 894, 8153, 30, 37154, 537, 5871, 1588, 2474, 7042, 5109, 525, 5990, 1101, 279, 1372, 13, 2055, 220, 18, 21, 18, 15, 15, 15, 15, 1035, 76156, 382, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 4718, 448, 1493, 1378, 9666, 315, 1995, 13, 2379, 3207, 944, 6286, 4113, 770, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 3421, 432, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 21, 18, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '202138dc05b343e692407b78c3e09177', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 367, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3445563316345215}}</strong>"
