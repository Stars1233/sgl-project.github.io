    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should check the parameters required for each. <br><br>For get_current_weather, I need a city, state, and unit. The user is in New York, so the city is \"New York\". Since New York is in New York State, the state would be \"NY\". They probably want the temperature in Fahrenheit, so the unit is \"fahrenheit\".<br><br>Next, for get_current_date, I need a timezone. The user is in New York, so I should use \"America/New_York\" as the timezone parameter.<br><br>Now, I should structure the messages correctly.

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '5bc62c2c03544f80a2a865bd8f4be9ed', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3173131942749023}}</strong>"

I\\'ll note that down. They probably need this in a structured format, hence the JSON request.\\n\\nI should verify the current population. I remember that Paris has a population around 2.1 million. But wait, populations change every year. I should check the latest data to be accurate. Maybe the current estimate is 2,150,000 as of 2023. It\\'s always good to mention that the data is up to date for context.\\n\\nAlso, the user might be looking for more info, like the percentage change. I recall that Paris\\'s population has been growing, perhaps about 1.7% from a decade ago. Including this can provide more insight.\\n\\nNow, structuring it in JSON. I\\'ll create an object with two main keys: \"capital\" and \"population\". Under \"capital\", I\\'ll have a nested object with \"name\" and \" Coordinates\". For population, another nested object including current population, historical data, and the year. That way, it\\'s organized and easy to read.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, using double braces and proper commas. Oh, and the city\\'s coordinates are essential for geographical context. Including them under the capital\\'s key will make it comprehensive.\\n\\nLet me double-check all the details to ensure accuracy. Population numbers can vary, so sticking to the most recent reliable sources is key. Once I\\'m confident, I\\'ll format it neatly for the user.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"Coordinates\": {\\n      \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n      \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"current\": 2150000,\\n    \"historical\": {\\n      \"2010\": 2148297,\\n      \"2020\": 2161779\\n    },\\n    \"year\": 2023\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 9625, 594, 6722, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 106004, 11, 1290, 30, 358, 3278, 5185, 429, 1495, 13, 2379, 4658, 1184, 419, 304, 264, 32930, 3561, 11, 16085, 279, 4718, 1681, 382, 40, 1265, 10146, 279, 1482, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 3526, 13, 1988, 3783, 11, 21910, 2297, 1449, 1042, 13, 358, 1265, 1779, 279, 5535, 821, 311, 387, 13382, 13, 10696, 279, 1482, 16045, 374, 220, 17, 11, 16, 20, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 1084, 594, 2677, 1661, 311, 6286, 429, 279, 821, 374, 705, 311, 2400, 369, 2266, 382, 13394, 11, 279, 1196, 2578, 387, 3330, 369, 803, 3546, 11, 1075, 279, 11414, 2297, 13, 358, 19091, 429, 12095, 594, 7042, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 8365, 911, 220, 16, 13, 22, 4, 504, 264, 13212, 4134, 13, 55121, 419, 646, 3410, 803, 20017, 382, 7039, 11, 2036, 1677, 432, 304, 4718, 13, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 1378, 1887, 6894, 25, 330, 65063, 1, 323, 330, 44441, 3263, 9449, 330, 65063, 497, 358, 3278, 614, 264, 24034, 1633, 448, 330, 606, 1, 323, 330, 62501, 3263, 1752, 7042, 11, 2441, 24034, 1633, 2670, 1482, 7042, 11, 13656, 821, 11, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 432, 594, 16645, 323, 4135, 311, 1349, 382, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 19482, 374, 4396, 11, 1667, 1990, 59191, 323, 6169, 76602, 13, 8670, 11, 323, 279, 3283, 594, 13934, 525, 7565, 369, 52901, 2266, 13, 55121, 1105, 1212, 279, 6722, 594, 1376, 686, 1281, 432, 15817, 382, 10061, 752, 1990, 15934, 678, 279, 3565, 311, 5978, 13403, 13, 39529, 5109, 646, 13289, 11, 773, 36972, 311, 279, 1429, 3213, 14720, 8173, 374, 1376, 13, 9646, 358, 2776, 16506, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 432, 62166, 369, 279, 1196, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 262, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 43876, 788, 341, 414, 330, 23718, 788, 220, 19, 23, 13, 23, 20, 21, 21, 345, 414, 330, 25446, 788, 220, 17, 13, 18, 20, 17, 17, 198, 262, 456, 220, 1153, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 341, 262, 330, 3231, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 262, 330, 43441, 938, 788, 341, 414, 330, 17, 15, 16, 15, 788, 220, 17, 16, 19, 23, 17, 24, 22, 345, 414, 330, 17, 15, 17, 15, 788, 220, 17, 16, 21, 16, 22, 22, 24, 198, 262, 1153, 262, 330, 3157, 788, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 198, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '68a0aac12db147adb2c015806c7f6970', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 471, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.0313074588775635}}</strong>"

For example, during the summer, the population might be higher because people go out. I think the figure I have is an estimate, maybe around 2.2 million. But to be accurate, I should check if there's a more precise current population or a standard figure used generally.\n",
