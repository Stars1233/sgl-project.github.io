    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes.

For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

I need to provide accurate data. \\n\\nFirst, I should verify the current population of Paris. I remember it\\'s a major city and as of recent estimates, it\\'s around 2.1 million people. I should check if this number has changed recently. Maybe I can look it up or recall the latest data sources. \\n\\nWait, could there be discrepancies? Sometimes population figures are approximate, especially for a city like Paris which is regularly monitored but estimates can fluctuate. I\\'ll have to ensure the data is up-to-date. Perhaps the latest figure from 2023 is available and reliable.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. It should include the city name, population figure, approximated population, and a note about the data being up-to-date. I\\'ll make sure to format it correctly with proper quotation marks and structure.\\n\\nLet me also think about the user\\'s intent. They asked for a JSON format, so they might be using this data programmatically. Therefore, accuracy is crucial. I don\\'t want any errors in the JSON syntax, so I\\'ll double-check that everything is correctly formatted.\\n\\nIs there anything else I need to consider? Maybe the city name should be in English as per the query. And since they mentioned \"population,\" I should provide both the exact number and an approximation for clarity. \\n\\nI think I\\'ve covered the necessary components. Now, I can put it all together in the JSON structure and present it to the user.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2181000,\\n    \"approximated_population\": 2170000,\\n    \"note\": \"Data is approximate and up-to-date as of recent estimates.\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 279, 6722, 374, 12095, 11, 1290, 30, 358, 1184, 311, 3410, 13382, 821, 13, 4710, 5338, 11, 358, 1265, 10146, 279, 1482, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 358, 6099, 432, 594, 264, 3598, 3283, 323, 438, 315, 3213, 17530, 11, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 3526, 1251, 13, 358, 1265, 1779, 421, 419, 1372, 702, 5497, 5926, 13, 10696, 358, 646, 1401, 432, 705, 476, 19091, 279, 5535, 821, 8173, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 1410, 1052, 387, 90267, 30, 17688, 7042, 12396, 525, 44868, 11, 5310, 369, 264, 3283, 1075, 12095, 892, 374, 15502, 40123, 714, 17530, 646, 38288, 6292, 13, 358, 3278, 614, 311, 5978, 279, 821, 374, 705, 4686, 18413, 13, 18765, 279, 5535, 7071, 504, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 374, 2500, 323, 14720, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 1084, 1265, 2924, 279, 3283, 829, 11, 7042, 7071, 11, 9848, 7145, 7042, 11, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 1660, 705, 4686, 18413, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 3561, 432, 12440, 448, 6169, 54231, 15423, 323, 5944, 382, 10061, 752, 1083, 1744, 911, 279, 1196, 594, 7385, 13, 2379, 4588, 369, 264, 4718, 3561, 11, 773, 807, 2578, 387, 1667, 419, 821, 55486, 7022, 13, 15277, 11, 13403, 374, 16587, 13, 358, 1513, 944, 1366, 894, 5975, 304, 279, 4718, 19482, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1990, 15934, 429, 4297, 374, 12440, 23126, 382, 3872, 1052, 4113, 770, 358, 1184, 311, 2908, 30, 10696, 279, 3283, 829, 1265, 387, 304, 6364, 438, 817, 279, 3239, 13, 1597, 2474, 807, 9733, 330, 44441, 1335, 358, 1265, 3410, 2176, 279, 4734, 1372, 323, 458, 56204, 369, 31273, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 358, 3003, 9761, 279, 5871, 6813, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 646, 2182, 432, 678, 3786, 304, 279, 4718, 5944, 323, 3042, 432, 311, 279, 1196, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 262, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 23, 16, 15, 15, 15, 345, 262, 330, 48053, 7145, 74572, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 262, 330, 9974, 788, 330, 1043, 374, 44868, 323, 705, 4686, 18413, 438, 315, 3213, 17530, 10040, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '895e1a2eb4374809af5eabf33daafa47', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 398, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.478644847869873}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out the population of the capital of France. Let me start by recalling that the capital of France is Paris. I remember this from school, but I'm not 100% sure, so maybe I should double-check that. Paris is indeed the administrative capital, and I think it's also the most populous city in France, which makes sense because it's such a major hub.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, regarding the population. I know that major cities in countries like France, which is a whole country, don't have populations over 30 million. Wait, but Paris is the capital and the largest city, so its population must be significant. I think it's around the 8 million mark. But I'm not sure about the exact number. I've heard it might be around 8.4 million. Let me think if there are any recent estimates or if it's been growing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember that population figures can vary depending on the source and the year it's measured. Some places use the official census data, which might be from 2020 or 2022. I'm not certain about the exact figure, but I think it's approximately 8.4 million people. Maybe I should consider whether this number includes just the city proper or the metropolitan area. Sometimes, population figures are given for the metropolitan area, which would include neighboring towns and regions. If that's the case, the number might be higher, like 12 million or so. But I believe the question is asking for the capital, which is Paris, so probably the city itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there are any recent changes or events that might affect the population, like births, deaths, or migrations. Natural increase is a factor, but I don't have real-time data, so I'll stick with the general estimates. I'm pretty confident that Paris's population is around 8.4 million, but to be precise, I might want to look up a recent source or a reliable demographic report to confirm this. However, since I'm doing this from memory, I'll go with 8.4 million as the population of Paris, the capital of France.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting this together, I need to present this information in JSON format. The user asked for the information and population, so I'll structure the JSON with a \"capital\" key containing the city name and a \"population\" key with the number. I should format it properly, ensuring that the number is correctly represented, possibly as a number without commas for simplicity or as a formatted string. I'll choose the former for clarity.\n",
