    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes.

For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

I know that the capital is Paris, so that\\'s where I\\'ll focus. I remember from school that Paris is a major city with a rich history and a lot of landmarks, but I\\'m not exactly sure about its current population. \\n\\nFirst, I should confirm if Paris is indeed the correct capital of France. From what I recall, yes, Paris has been the capital of France since a long time ago, maybe even since the Parisian这块 indicia was established. That\\'s an interesting historical fact, but I might not need that for this task.\\n\\nNext, I need to find out the population. I think I\\'ve heard that Paris is the most populous city in France, but I\\'m not sure about its exact population figure. I remember reading somewhere that it\\'s in the region of the 50-60 million mark, maybe around 21 million? I\\'m not entirely sure, so I should probably look this up to be certain.\\n\\nWait, I should think about how to get accurate data. I can\\'t just guess; I need reliable information. Since I can\\'t access the internet right now, I\\'ll have to go with what I remember. I think the population of Paris was around 21 or 22 million a few years back. Maybe it\\'s higher now because more people are moving there for work or studies.\\n\\nAnother thought: Paris\\'s population is known to be diverse, with people from all over the world. So, the population figure must reflect that diversity. It\\'s also the economic hub, so many people from other regions might end up in Paris, contributing to its growth.\\n\\nI should also consider if there\\'s any recent change in Paris\\'s status in France\\'s government. I know that Paris is a city, not a region likeÎle-de-France, so maybe its population figures are handled separately from the rest of the country. That might explain why it\\'s often discussed on its own.\\n\\nWait, but I don\\'t think the capital has changed hands since a long time. Paris has always been the seat of government, culture, and politics for France. So unless there\\'s been some major change, that shouldn\\'t affect the population number.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'m going to say that the capital, Paris, has a population of approximately 21.5 million people. I\\'m not entirely confident about the exact number, but that\\'s what I remember from general knowledge.

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out the population of the capital of France, which is Paris, and present it in JSON format. I remember that Paris is the most populous city in France, but I'm not exactly sure about the current population numbers. Let me think. I've heard it's around 2 million people. But I also recall that population figures can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, is it exactly 2 million, or is it slightly more? I think it's a bit over 2 million. Maybe around 2.1 million? Or could it be higher now? I'm not certain. I should probably check the latest data, but since I can't access the internet right now, I'll have to go with my best estimate. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've heard estimates ranging from 2.1 to 2.2 million. I think the most recent figure I've come across was around 2.2 million. So, I'll go with that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, how do I format this into JSON? JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll need a key for the capital city and another for the population. The keys should be in English, and the population number should be an integer. So, the structure would look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2200000}. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, is 2.2 million written as 2200000 in JSON? Yes, because in JSON, numbers don't have commas, so 2,200,000 becomes 2200000. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me make sure I'm following the correct syntax. JSON requires that strings be enclosed in double quotes, and numbers don't need quotes. So, the correct format should be {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2200000}. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything else I need to consider? Maybe the units. The population is in people, so 2,200,000 people. But since it's a number, just 2200000 is fine. \n",
