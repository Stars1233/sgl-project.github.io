    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'e9d3ada82bf045feae344eb00635dae4', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3566927909851074}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I need to figure out the current population of the capital of France, which is Paris. Since I\\'m a bit new to this, I might not know the exact number, but I can work it out.\\n\\nFirst, I remember that major cities around the world often have populations that are in the millions. Paris is known as one of the largest cities in Europe, so it\\'s definitely going to be a big number. I think it\\'s over 10 million people these days.\\n\\nI also recall that population numbers can change frequently due to births, deaths, and migration. So the figure might not be exactly static and could vary from year to year. I\\'m not sure about the exact number, but I know it\\'s somewhere around 8 to 11 million.\\n\\nI\\'m trying to remember if I\\'ve heard any recent statistics. I think in the 2010s, Paris had a population around 8.5 to 9 million. However, populations can increase over time, so the number might have grown a bit more recently.\\n\\nI should also consider that data sources can vary. Some estimates might come from official statistics offices, while others might be based on projections or other models. It\\'s possible that different sources have slightly different numbers.\\n\\nI\\'m trying to think if there\\'s a reliable source I can reference. The World Bank or the United Nations might have accurate data on this. According to my knowledge cut-off in October 2023, the estimated population was around 8.7 million. But just to be safe, I should mention that this number is an estimate and can change.\\n\\nSo putting all this together, I can conclude that Paris\\'s population is approximately 8.7 million. I\\'ll present this information in a JSON format as requested.\\n</think>\\n\\nCertainly! Here\\'s the information about the population of Paris, the capital of France, presented in a JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 8700000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 1482, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 11, 892, 374, 12095, 13, 8704, 358, 2776, 264, 2699, 501, 311, 419, 11, 358, 2578, 537, 1414, 279, 4734, 1372, 11, 714, 358, 646, 975, 432, 700, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 6099, 429, 3598, 9720, 2163, 279, 1879, 3545, 614, 21910, 429, 525, 304, 279, 11728, 13, 12095, 374, 3881, 438, 825, 315, 279, 7772, 9720, 304, 4505, 11, 773, 432, 594, 8491, 2087, 311, 387, 264, 2409, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 16, 15, 3526, 1251, 1493, 2849, 382, 40, 1083, 19091, 429, 7042, 5109, 646, 2297, 13814, 4152, 311, 65232, 11, 16375, 11, 323, 11906, 13, 2055, 279, 7071, 2578, 537, 387, 6896, 1099, 323, 1410, 13289, 504, 1042, 311, 1042, 13, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 911, 279, 4734, 1372, 11, 714, 358, 1414, 432, 594, 14696, 2163, 220, 23, 311, 220, 16, 16, 3526, 382, 40, 2776, 4460, 311, 6099, 421, 358, 3003, 6617, 894, 3213, 13142, 13, 358, 1744, 304, 279, 220, 17, 15, 16, 15, 82, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 2163, 220, 23, 13, 20, 311, 220, 24, 3526, 13, 4354, 11, 21910, 646, 5263, 916, 882, 11, 773, 279, 1372, 2578, 614, 14700, 264, 2699, 803, 5926, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 429, 821, 8173, 646, 13289, 13, 4329, 17530, 2578, 2525, 504, 3946, 13142, 19126, 11, 1393, 3800, 2578, 387, 3118, 389, 40479, 476, 1008, 4119, 13, 1084, 594, 3204, 429, 2155, 8173, 614, 10078, 2155, 5109, 382, 40, 2776, 4460, 311, 1744, 421, 1052, 594, 264, 14720, 2530, 358, 646, 5785, 13, 576, 4337, 8547, 476, 279, 3639, 19140, 2578, 614, 13382, 821, 389, 419, 13, 10548, 311, 847, 6540, 3931, 12462, 304, 6527, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 279, 12943, 7042, 572, 2163, 220, 23, 13, 22, 3526, 13, 1988, 1101, 311, 387, 6092, 11, 358, 1265, 6286, 429, 419, 1372, 374, 458, 16045, 323, 646, 2297, 382, 4416, 10687, 678, 419, 3786, 11, 358, 646, 31094, 429, 12095, 594, 7042, 374, 13187, 220, 23, 13, 22, 3526, 13, 358, 3278, 3042, 419, 1995, 304, 264, 4718, 3561, 438, 11223, 624, 151649, 271, 95456, 0, 5692, 594, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 11, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 11, 10449, 304, 264, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 23, 22, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '16debc0629614fcab903150f6d5ca36a', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 414, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.525627851486206}}</strong>"
