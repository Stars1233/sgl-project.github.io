    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes.

For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I need to figure out the capital of France and then provide its population in JSON format. Let me start by recalling what I know about France. I remember that Paris is the capital of France, which is pretty common knowledge. But let me double-check that to be sure. No, wait, I think it\\'s definitely Paris.\\n\\nNow, the next part is about the population. I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number, so I might need to look that up or estimate based on recent data. I think a few years back, the population around Paris was around 2 million. But it\\'s been growing, so maybe now it\\'s a bit higher. Let me see if I can recall any recent statistics. I think it might be around 2.2 million. But I\\'m not certain, so I should verify that.\\n\\nWait, actually, thinking again, I remember that Paris is one of the largest cities in the world, and its population is significantly large. Maybe it\\'s over 3 million now. Or perhaps I\\'m mixing it up with other cities. No, I think it\\'s still around 2.2 million, but I could be wrong. Maybe I should look it up to confirm. Oh well, since I don\\'t have the internet, I\\'ll have to go with my best estimate.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I know the capital is Paris, and the population is approximately 2.2 million. So, I can structure this into a JSON format, making sure to include the correct key-value pairs. The key should be the capital name, and the value should be the population in a number format. I should also ensure that the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.\\n\\nWait, actually, when I think about it, Paris has multiple boroughs, like the arrondissements, but the total population refers to the entire city, not just the Île-de-France region. So, the population number should reflect the entire metropolitan area of Paris.\\n\\nI think I\\'m confident enough that the capital is Paris, and the population is roughly 2.2 million. Now, how do I format this into JSON? I believe it should be a key-value pair where the key is \"capital\" and the value is the population number. I\\'ll make sure to write it with proper syntax, using curly braces and quotes where necessary.\\n\\nDouble-checking the JSON format: the string should be enclosed in double quotes, and the key and value should be separated by a colon, with the entire object enclosed in curly braces. No, wait, in JSON, string values are enclosed in double quotes, keys are strings too, and the whole structure is enclosed in curly braces. So, it should look like {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2200000}. But I think the population should be a number, not a string, so maybe I should write it as 2200000 without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll write the JSON like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2200000}. But I\\'m still a bit uncertain about the exact population number. Maybe it\\'s closer to 2.3 million or 2.1 million.

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out the population of the capital of France. First, I should determine which city is the capital. I remember that Paris is the capital of France, so that's where I'll focus. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to find out the current population of Paris. I think the population numbers change over time because people move in and out, births, deaths, and migration affect it. I'm not exactly sure of the exact number, but I believe it's around 3 million. Maybe a bit more or less? I'm not 100% certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should check if the user wants the information in a specific format. The user mentioned JSON format, so I'll have to structure it properly. JSON is a data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and machines to parse. It uses key-value pairs, so I'll need a key like \"capital\" and a value that's another object containing \"name\" and \"population\".\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the structure would look like this: {\"capital\": {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 3_000_000}}. I need to make sure the commas are correct and that the population number is accurate. I should probably mention that the population is approximate because it can vary from year to year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the exact population might be a bit different, but I think 3 million is a commonly cited number. Maybe I should add a note that the population is approximate. That way, it's clear that the figure isn't exact and could change over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the formatting of the JSON. It should be valid, so I'll make sure to use the correct syntax with quotes and underscores for the number. No trailing commas, that's important for JSON validity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll create a JSON object with the name \"Paris\" under the \"name\" key and 3,000,000 under \"population\". Then, I'll include a comment or a note explaining that the population is approximate.\n",
