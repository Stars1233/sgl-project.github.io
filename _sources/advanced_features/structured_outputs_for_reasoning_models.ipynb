    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

No, I'm pretty sure France's capital is Paris. Maybe I should double-check that to be certain. Yeah, Paris is where the government is located, and that's the capital.

I'll need to use both. <br><br>Starting with the date, I'll use 'get_current_date'. The parameter required is 'timezone', and the value should be 'America/New_York'. That should give me the current date and time in that timezone. <br><br>Next, for the weather, I'll use 'get_current_weather'. The parameters needed are 'city' as 'New York', 'state' as 'NY', and 'unit' as 'fahrenheit' since the user didn't specify, but Fahrenheit is commonly used in the US. <br><br>I should make sure to format the function calls correctly. Each function call should be on its own line with the appropriate parameters in JSON format. I'll also include the sources in the response to show where the information came from. <br><br>Wait, the user didn't specify the unit for temperature, so I'll default to Fahrenheit.

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'bac0f41b1a0b43b6af6ae095eb4fecce', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3481285572052}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user query. They want me to give them the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Alright, first, I should identify the capital of France. From what I know, Paris is the capital of France. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population data for Paris. Hmm, I\\'m not exactly sure about the current figure, but I remember that it\\'s a large city, so the population must be in the millions. I think around 2 million people. But wait, I also recall that the population can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. So maybe the figure I have isn\\'t the most recent. \\n\\nThe user is asking specifically for the JSON format. JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange format that\\'s easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. So I need to structure the information my user is asking for into a JSON object. \\n\\nI should probably key in \"City\" as the first field, and assign it the value \"Paris\". Then, under \"Population\", I should put the approximate number. Since I\\'m a bit unsure about the exact figure, I might note a comment that the figure might vary. \\n\\nWait, maybe I should include the date as well for context. Typically, population figures change every five years in some countries, and in France, the census is conducted every ten years. So as of the last census in 2022, Paris had around 2,174,000 residents. But it\\'s always good to check if I\\'m up to date. \\n\\nHmm, I should also consider the units, but I think in this case, just providing the number without units is fine since it\\'s pretty standard. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure would have a key-value pair where the key is \"capital\" and the value is another object containing \"City\" and \"Population\". So the structure would be something like:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"City\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"Population\": 2174000\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nBut I should also add a comment or note that reminds the user that the population figure might change over time. That way, they know that the data is approximate and could be subject to change based on various factors.\\n\\nWait, maybe the user just needs the basic information without any extra details. They didn\\'t specify a date, so perhaps the most recent data is sufficient. Since the last census was in 2022, that\\'s a reasonable point in time for the data.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, using double quotes for strings and commas appropriately. Also, the keys should be in lowercase as per JSON standards unless specified otherwise.\\n\\nLet me double-check the population number. I did a quick search in my mind, and I think around 2.17 million is about right for Paris. So I\\'ll go with 2174000. \\n\\nIs there a reason the user might need this information? Maybe for a school project, a travel blog, or just general knowledge. Probably, they\\'re looking for a straightforward data structure without too much explanation. \\n\\nAlso, I should present the JSON clearly and concisely, avoiding any unnecessary information.

      "Generated text: Alright, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I need to figure out who the user is and what they're looking for. It seems like they're asking for a straightforward data query, so maybe they're working on a project or just need quick facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that the capital of France is Paris, so that's the key point. Now, I should consider what information they need beyond just the name. They specifically mentioned the population, so I need accurate data on that. I remember that population numbers can change over time, so I should use the most recent estimate. As of 2023, Paris has a population of around 2.2 million. I should verify that this number is up to date because population figures can fluctuate due to births, deaths, and migration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON is a data interchange format that's easy to read and write for both humans and machines. It's important to format it correctly so it's valid and can be easily parsed if needed. I'll create an object with a \"name\" key for the city and a \"population\" key with the number. Since the population is an estimate, I'll include a \"description\" to clarify that it's an approximate figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure to format the JSON properly, using the correct syntax like double quotes for keys and string values, and commas in the right places to avoid errors. It's crucial that the JSON is valid, so I'll double-check the structure before presenting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure the response is helpful and meets the user's needs without unnecessary information. I'll keep the language simple and direct, as the user seems to be looking for factual data without any additional fluff.\n",
