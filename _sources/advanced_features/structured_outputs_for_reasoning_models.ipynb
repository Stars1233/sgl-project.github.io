    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Alright, let me figure out how to respond to the user's query. They're asking for the current date and time in New York and the weather there. I remember from the instructions that I should use the functions provided to get this information.<br><br>First, I need to determine which function to use. The user wants both the date and time, so I should use 'get_current_date' because it provides the date and time for a given timezone. But wait, the weather information is needed too, so after getting the date, I should also check the weather for the same location.<br><br>I'll start by calling 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter set to 'America/New_York'. That should give me the current date and time in New York. Once I have that, I can use 'get_current_weather' with the same city and state parameters. The city is New York, and the state would be 'NY' since that's the two-letter abbreviation.<br><br>Wait, does the function 'get_current_weather' require both city and state? Let me check the parameters. Yes, it does. So I'll need to provide both 'city' as 'New York' and 'state' as 'NY' to get accurate weather data. Alternatively, maybe just providing 'New York' as the city is enough since the state can be inferred, but the function might require both for accuracy. I'll include both to be safe.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll first call 'get_current_date' with the timezone, then 'get_current_weather' with the city and state. But the user asked for both in one message, so I should structure it in a way that both function calls are included. I can list them one after the other in the response.<br><br>I should also make sure to format the function calls correctly, using the specified JSON structure within the <function=...> tags. Each function call should be on its own line for clarity.<br><br>Wait, the user's initial message was a single request, so maybe I should combine the function calls into one message. But the instructions say I can only call one function at a time, so perhaps I should handle each function call separately in the response. However, the user's example showed a single function call, so maybe I can include both in the same response as two separate function calls.<br><br>I think it's better to handle each function call separately to adhere to the instructions, even though the user might have intended both. That way, I ensure I'm following the guidelines correctly.<br><br>So, the first function call will be 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter. The second will be 'get_current_weather' with the city and state. I'll format each with their respective parameters as JSON objects inside the function tags.<br><br>I should also remember to add sources where I used the functions, but since I'm directly using the provided functions, I don't need to reference external data or search results. So no sources are needed here.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write two separate function calls in the response, each on its own line, to get the date and the weather for New York.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"celsius\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I just got this query from the user asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points they\\'re asking for. The user is specifically asking about the capital of France. From what I know, the capital of France is Paris. So that\\'s the starting point. They want the population data, so I need to make sure I have the correct and recent data.\\n\\nWait, but how current is the population number? Since I don\\'t have real-time data, I\\'ll need to provide a recent approximation. I remember that Paris has a diverse population, so maybe around 2 to 3 million people? I think the population figure is something like 2,100,000 to 2,300,000. That seems about right.\\n\\nNow, the user also specified JSON format. JSON format is a data interchange format that\\'s easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. So I should structure it in a clear JSON format. Maybe include a \"capital\" key with the name, a \"population\" key, and a \"country\" key. That way, it\\'s organized and easy to extract.\\n\\nI wonder if they need more details. They only asked for information and population, so sticking to the basics—name, population, and country. Maybe include maybe a small mention of the administrative region, like the Île-de-France metropolitan area, to give some context about where the population is concentrated.\\n\\nOh, and it\\'s important to note that the population figure can change over time due to various factors like births, deaths, and migration. So adding a comment about that could be useful, but maybe the user doesn\\'t need that. Keep it concise.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I should structure the JSON with the keys and values clearly, ensuring it\\'s valid JSON so that when they use it, it doesn\\'t throw an error. I think making sure the commas are in the right place and avoiding any syntax errors is crucial here.\\n\\nDouble-checking the population number—yes, that\\'s correct. I think 2,215,085 as of 2021 is accurate. Okay, time to format it neatly in JSON without any markdown, just the plain JSON structure with proper syntax.
