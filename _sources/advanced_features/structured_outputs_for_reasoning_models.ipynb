    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

From what I remember, Paris has a population around 2 million, but I should verify that. Also, I should include other relevant details like the administrative region, area, and some notable landmarks. I need to structure this information neatly in JSON, making it easy to read and understand. I should also ensure that the population number is correct and up-to-date, maybe cross-check it with a reliable source to avoid any mistakes. Once I have all the details, I'll format them into a JSON structure with proper keys and values. I think that's all the user needs, so I'll present it clearly.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of France\\'s capital in JSON format. Alright, first I need to identify which city that is. I recall that the capital of France is Paris. So that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNow, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is the largest city in France and one of the most populous in the world, but I don\\'t remember the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million people. But to be accurate, I should check a recent source or a reliable database.\\n\\nHmm, let me think. I believe the population has been increasing over the years due to urban development and migration. Maybe it\\'s over 2.1 million now. I think I\\'ve heard that Paris is projected to grow further. So I\\'ll go with approximately 2.2 million as the current population. \\n\\nWait, am I 100% sure? I\\'m a bit unsure about the exact number. Maybe it\\'s 2.16 million? That sounds more precise. Okay, I\\'ll note that. So the population is roughly 2.16 million people. \\n\\nNow, how should I format this? The user asked for JSON, so I should structure the information in key-value pairs. I\\'ll have \"Capital\" as a key pointing to \"Paris\" and \"Population\" as another key with the number. \\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotes. Also, I\\'ll format the number with commas for readability, so 2,160,000. That makes it clear. \\n\\nPutting it all together, it\\'s straightforward. I can present the JSON as the answer. I don\\'t think I need to add anything else, but I should double-check the population number to be accurate. Maybe I should mention that the population figure is approximate or up to a certain year, just in case. \\n\\nYes, adding a note that the population is approximate and up to a certain year would be helpful. The user might not be aware that population figures can change over time.

I think the metropolitan area population is somewhere between 6 to 7 million. I should double-check that to ensure it's correct.\n",

      "Now, structuring this into JSON. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \"metropolitan_area\". The population should be an integer, and the metropolitan area as well. I'll make sure to include the units, like \"thousands\" for the metropolitan area to avoid confusion.\n",
