    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

First, I need to figure out what cities in France are considered capitals. I know Paris is the most well-known and the main capital. Madagascar is also a capital, but it\\'s a very small place. So, Paris is likely the one they\\'re referring to.\\n\\nI should look up the current population of Paris. From what I remember, populations can change, so I better double-check. As of recent data, Paris has a population of around 2.2 million people. That seems about right.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires using key-value pairs, so keys like \"capital\" and \"population\" make sense here. I\\'ll make sure to include units for clarity—kilometers for area and square kilometers for population.\\n\\nI should also add an \"area\" field to give a bit more context about the city. Paris\\'s area is roughly 105 square kilometers, and knowing it\\'s 97% urban helps set the stage for the population density.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should be clear and concise, providing the user with the information they need efficiently.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2223146413,\\n  \"area\": 105.14,\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n  },\\n  \"country\": \"France\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n(Note: The population figure is an approximation and may vary depending on the source and the year of measurement.)', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1128, 9720, 304, 9625, 525, 6509, 92999, 13, 358, 1414, 12095, 374, 279, 1429, 1632, 21309, 323, 279, 1887, 6722, 13, 94628, 374, 1083, 264, 6722, 11, 714, 432, 594, 264, 1602, 2613, 1992, 13, 2055, 11, 12095, 374, 4363, 279, 825, 807, 2299, 22023, 311, 382, 40, 1265, 1401, 705, 279, 1482, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 5542, 1128, 358, 6099, 11, 21910, 646, 2297, 11, 773, 358, 2664, 1990, 15934, 13, 1634, 315, 3213, 821, 11, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 315, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 1251, 13, 2938, 4977, 911, 1290, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 7460, 1667, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 6894, 1075, 330, 65063, 1, 323, 330, 44441, 1, 1281, 5530, 1588, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 8153, 369, 31273, 2293, 85526, 32404, 369, 3082, 323, 9334, 40568, 369, 7042, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 458, 330, 4798, 1, 2070, 311, 2968, 264, 2699, 803, 2266, 911, 279, 3283, 13, 12095, 594, 3082, 374, 17267, 220, 16, 15, 20, 9334, 40568, 11, 323, 14063, 432, 594, 220, 24, 22, 4, 15662, 8609, 738, 279, 6430, 369, 279, 7042, 17457, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 387, 2797, 323, 63594, 11, 8241, 279, 1196, 448, 279, 1995, 807, 1184, 29720, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 17, 17, 18, 16, 19, 21, 19, 16, 18, 345, 220, 330, 4798, 788, 220, 16, 15, 20, 13, 16, 19, 345, 220, 330, 34739, 788, 341, 262, 330, 23718, 788, 220, 19, 23, 13, 23, 20, 21, 21, 345, 262, 330, 25446, 788, 220, 17, 13, 18, 20, 17, 17, 198, 220, 1153, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 698, 532, 13874, 19324, 89389, 25, 576, 7042, 7071, 374, 458, 56204, 323, 1231, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 315, 18662, 6138, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '1e7e9a9aae2543379bad1046ef698d7b', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 362, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.358292818069458}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to figure out which city is the capital of France. I know Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. Now, I have to recall or look up the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city and one of the largest in France, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact population number. I think it's over 3 million, maybe around 3.5 million? But to be accurate, I should check that. Wait, I think the current population is approximately 3,500,000. That seems right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to structure this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, so it's a way to represent data structures. I'll need to create an object with relevant fields. The user mentioned \"information and population,\" so I should include the city name, the fact that it's the capital, the population number, and possibly the region it belongs to.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted. Each key should be in double quotes, and the values can be numbers or strings. So, I'll have a main object, maybe call it \"capitalInfo,\" with keys like \"city,\" \"isCapital,\" \"population,\" and \"region.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me also consider the population figure. It's important to note that population numbers can change over time due to various factors like births, deaths, and migration. So, the number I provide should be the most recent estimate available. I think the latest data from 2023 might be around 3.5 million, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, including the region can add more context. Paris is in the Ile-de-France region, which is known for having a large urban area. That's a good addition as it gives more geographical context.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about the structure. The user might want a simple structure, so including the essential fields should suffice. No need for nested objects unless specified, so I'll keep it straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capitalInfo\": {\n",
      "    \"city\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "    \"isCapital\": true,\n",
      "    \"population\": 3500000,\n",
      "    \"region\": \"Ile-de-France\"\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid. Maybe I'll double-check the population number to ensure accuracy. Also, considering the user's request, they might be using this data for a project or a presentation, so accuracy is key.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, I need to provide the correct city name, confirm it's the capital, give an accurate population figure, and specify the region. The JSON structure should be clear and easy to read. I think this covers everything the user asked for.\n",
