    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I need to figure out how to get the current date and time for New York. I remember there's a function called get_current_date. It requires a timezone parameter. The user mentioned New York, so I should look up the correct timezone abbreviation for that location. New York is EST, which stands for Eastern Standard Time. So the timezone parameter should be 'EST'.<br><br>Next, I need to retrieve the current weather in New York. The function for that is get_current_weather. It requires a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, but I need the state abbreviation. New York is NY, so the state parameter is 'NY'. The unit should be Fahrenheit since the user didn't specify, but I should make sure to include that in the function call.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll call get_current_date with the timezone as 'EST' and then get_current_weather with city as 'New York', state as 'NY', and unit as 'fahrenheit'.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

I need to find the latest population data for Paris. Wait, populations can change, and the numbers might not be exact. I should check a reliable source to get the most accurate figure.\\n\\nI remember that recent years have seen Paris going through population growth, but maybe it\\'s tempered by some factors like urbanization or area changes. I should consider whether the statistics include just the city proper or the broader Île-de-France region. Sometimes, people just mention Paris without the suburbs, so I should clarify that.\\n\\nAlso, depending on the source, the numbers can vary a bit. For example, some places might round the population, so it\\'s important to note that it\\'s an approximate figure.

      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's a fact I remember. Now, I need to find the population of Paris. I'm not exactly sure about the exact number, but I know it's a major city, so the population must be in the hundreds of millions. Wait, no, Paris is the capital, but it's not the most populous city in France. The most populous city there is metropolitan Paris, which includes a larger area than just the city limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recall that as of recent estimates, the population of Paris is around 12 million. But I should verify that. Maybe I can think about when the population was around 12 million. I think that was the figure a few years back, but populations can fluctuate due to various factors like births, deaths, and migration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to represent data structures. It's commonly used for transmitting data in web applications. The structure should include the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and the key \"population\" with the value of 12 million. But I should make sure to format it correctly with proper syntax, using quotation marks and commas in the right places.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should also consider if I'm using the correct population figure. Let me think again. I believe the population of Paris is actually higher than 12 million when considering the metropolitan area. metropolitan Paris has a population of around 12.5 million. So maybe I should check that. But since I'm not entirely certain, perhaps I should present both and see which one the user expects. However, the user didn't specify, so I'll go with the standard city population of 12 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should present the information clearly in JSON. So, the structure would be an object with two key-value pairs. Let me make sure that the JSON is valid. Each key should be in quotes, and the values should also be in quotes if they are strings. The entire structure should be properly formatted with braces and commas.\n",
