    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '72aae784a7664eeeaad349551b3fc6d1', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 2.4321093559265137}}\n"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. <br><br>Next, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what exactly they\\'re asking for. The capital of France is definitely Paris, right? So, I should provide details about Paris and its population.\\n\\nI wonder, what\\'s the most recent population figure available? I think as of 2023, the population might be around 3 million. Wait, but maybe it\\'s more accurate to check known data. I remember that Paris is a major city in France known for its dense population. So, the population figure I found earlier was 3,554,081 as of 2022. That seems about right.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON is a data interchange format, so I\\'ll need to structure it properly. They probably need this for some kind of data analysis or a project, maybe programming or a script where they\\'ll use this data. They didn\\'t specify any particular use case, so just providing the data in a clear JSON format should suffice.\\n\\nI should make sure that the JSON is correctly formatted. So, including the key-value pairs with the country name and population. I\\'ll also add a description to explain that Paris is the capital and its approximate population. That way, the information is clear and complete.\\n\\nI also need to consider if the user might need the population figure for a specific year. Since population can change, maybe I should clarify if they need the latest data or just a general figure. But since they didn\\'t specify, I\\'ll go with the most recent I have. \\n\\nAnother thing to think about is whether the user should be advised to check the latest stats online, just in case. But since they asked for the information, providing what I have is the right approach. \\n\\nAlright, putting it all together. I\\'ll structure it with a key for the country, another for the population, and a description that ties it all together. That should make the response clear and useful for whatever the user\\'s next step is.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"population\": 3554081,\\n  \"description\": \"Paris is the capital city of France and has a population of approximately 3,554,081 as of the latest estimates.\"\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 358, 1101, 3949, 264, 3239, 504, 264, 1196, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 1077, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1128, 6896, 807, 2299, 10161, 369, 13, 576, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 8491, 12095, 11, 1290, 30, 2055, 11, 358, 1265, 3410, 3565, 911, 12095, 323, 1181, 7042, 382, 40, 5775, 11, 1128, 594, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 7071, 2500, 30, 358, 1744, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 279, 7042, 2578, 387, 2163, 220, 18, 3526, 13, 13824, 11, 714, 7196, 432, 594, 803, 13382, 311, 1779, 3881, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 304, 9625, 3881, 369, 1181, 27950, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 279, 7042, 7071, 358, 1730, 6788, 572, 220, 18, 11, 20, 20, 19, 11, 15, 23, 16, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 17, 13, 2938, 4977, 911, 1290, 382, 7039, 11, 279, 1196, 6801, 419, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 374, 264, 821, 51263, 3561, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1184, 311, 5944, 432, 10277, 13, 2379, 4658, 1184, 419, 369, 1045, 3093, 315, 821, 6358, 476, 264, 2390, 11, 7196, 15473, 476, 264, 5316, 1380, 807, 3278, 990, 419, 821, 13, 2379, 3207, 944, 13837, 894, 3953, 990, 1142, 11, 773, 1101, 8241, 279, 821, 304, 264, 2797, 4718, 3561, 1265, 76156, 382, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 12440, 23126, 13, 2055, 11, 2670, 279, 1376, 19083, 13530, 448, 279, 3146, 829, 323, 7042, 13, 358, 3278, 1083, 912, 264, 4008, 311, 10339, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 323, 1181, 44868, 7042, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 279, 1995, 374, 2797, 323, 4583, 382, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 2908, 421, 279, 1196, 2578, 1184, 279, 7042, 7071, 369, 264, 3151, 1042, 13, 8704, 7042, 646, 2297, 11, 7196, 358, 1265, 37163, 421, 807, 1184, 279, 5535, 821, 476, 1101, 264, 4586, 7071, 13, 1988, 2474, 807, 3207, 944, 13837, 11, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 358, 614, 13, 4710, 14037, 3166, 311, 1744, 911, 374, 3425, 279, 1196, 1265, 387, 25104, 311, 1779, 279, 5535, 10472, 2860, 11, 1101, 304, 1142, 13, 1988, 2474, 807, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 11, 8241, 1128, 358, 614, 374, 279, 1290, 5486, 13, 4710, 71486, 11, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 13, 358, 3278, 5944, 432, 448, 264, 1376, 369, 279, 3146, 11, 2441, 369, 279, 7042, 11, 323, 264, 4008, 429, 19818, 432, 678, 3786, 13, 2938, 1265, 1281, 279, 2033, 2797, 323, 5390, 369, 8820, 279, 1196, 594, 1790, 3019, 374, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 20, 19, 15, 23, 16, 345, 220, 330, 4684, 788, 330, 59604, 374, 279, 6722, 3283, 315, 9625, 323, 702, 264, 7042, 315, 13187, 220, 18, 11, 20, 20, 19, 11, 15, 23, 16, 438, 315, 279, 5535, 17530, 10040, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '21122b22ef984188a73418598e4ca946', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 513, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.1417486667633057}}</strong>"
