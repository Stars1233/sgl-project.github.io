    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'f22f25e882404215aa955098e8a1dbeb', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.8199450969696045}}</strong>"

They want the information and population of France\\'s capital, Paris, in JSON format. \\n\\nFirst, I should verify the current population of Paris. Population figures can change yearly, so it\\'s important to get the most recent data. I\\'ll check a reliable source to ensure accuracy. \\n\\nI recall that the population of Paris was around 2 million in recent years, but I need to confirm the exact number. Let me think—I believe it was approximately 2,153,000 as of 2022. That seems about right.\\n\\nNext, I should structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so the keys will be \"city\" and \"population\", with their respective values. \\n\\nI also want to present this as a JSON array, even though there\\'s only one item since the user specified just the capital. Including this array might provide a more organized structure if they were to collect more data in the future.\\n\\nI need to ensure the JSON is properly formatted without any syntax errors. Each key should be in double quotes, and the values should accurately reflect the population number. I\\'ll make sure there are commas where necessary, but since it\\'s an array with one element, I\\'ll check that the comma is present if more elements are added later.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, as the user requested. I should also keep the explanation brief, just confirming that I used the data from 2022 to ensure it\\'s up-to-date.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2153000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object contains the following information:\\n- The city name is \"Paris\"\\n- The population is 2,153,000 (as of 2022)', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 1077, 594, 21403, 279, 1196, 594, 3239, 13, 2379, 1366, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 9625, 594, 6722, 11, 12095, 11, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 4710, 5338, 11, 358, 1265, 10146, 279, 1482, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 39529, 12396, 646, 2297, 44270, 11, 773, 432, 594, 2989, 311, 633, 279, 1429, 3213, 821, 13, 358, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 311, 5978, 13403, 13, 4710, 40, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 572, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 304, 3213, 1635, 11, 714, 358, 1184, 311, 7683, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 50657, 4411, 432, 572, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 16, 20, 18, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 17, 13, 2938, 4977, 911, 1290, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1265, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 7460, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 279, 6894, 686, 387, 330, 8926, 1, 323, 330, 44441, 497, 448, 862, 19511, 2750, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1366, 311, 3042, 419, 438, 264, 4718, 1334, 11, 1496, 3498, 1052, 594, 1172, 825, 1509, 2474, 279, 1196, 5189, 1101, 279, 6722, 13, 55121, 419, 1334, 2578, 3410, 264, 803, 16645, 5944, 421, 807, 1033, 311, 6530, 803, 821, 304, 279, 3853, 382, 40, 1184, 311, 5978, 279, 4718, 374, 10277, 23126, 2041, 894, 19482, 5975, 13, 8886, 1376, 1265, 387, 304, 1990, 17194, 11, 323, 279, 2750, 1265, 29257, 8708, 279, 7042, 1372, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 76602, 1380, 5871, 11, 714, 2474, 432, 594, 458, 1334, 448, 825, 2392, 11, 358, 3278, 1779, 429, 279, 31683, 374, 3042, 421, 803, 5424, 525, 3694, 2937, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2797, 323, 63594, 11566, 11, 438, 279, 1196, 11223, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 2506, 279, 16148, 9814, 11, 1101, 48996, 429, 358, 1483, 279, 821, 504, 220, 17, 15, 17, 17, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 705, 4686, 18413, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 18, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 13874, 19324, 1986, 4718, 1633, 5610, 279, 2701, 1995, 510, 12, 576, 3283, 829, 374, 330, 59604, 698, 12, 576, 7042, 374, 220, 17, 11, 16, 20, 18, 11, 15, 15, 15, 320, 300, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 17, 8, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'be2e5873e2484383a0e2767d3cff3f36', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 407, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.9991421699523926}}</strong>"

Hmm, the capital is straightforward—it's Paris. But population numbers can be a bit tricky. I remember that France's population has been growing, but exact numbers can vary based on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a year, so I'll go with the most recent estimate, which I think is around 3.5 million. I should check if there's a more precise figure, but I'm not sure if it's worth going further into detail. Also, I should make sure to present it clearly in JSON format as they requested.
