    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the current date and time in New York along with the weather. Let me break this down. The user mentioned they're in New York, so I should probably get the current date and time for that location. But wait, do I need to specify the timezone? Yeah, because New York has its own timezone, probably Eastern Time. <br><br>Hmm, looking at the functions provided, there's 'get_current_date' which requires a timezone parameter. So I should call that function with the timezone set to 'America/New_York'. That should give me the current date and time in that specific location. <br><br>Next, for the weather. The user is in New York, but I'm not sure which city and state exactly. New York is a state, and the city might be New York City. Wait, the function 'get_current_weather' requires a city and state. So I should use 'New York City' as the city and 'NY' as the state. Also, the unit is needed. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I should default to Fahrenheit because that's what most users are familiar with, but I think Celsius is more common in the US. Oh, wait, in the function description, Fahrenheit is one of the options. So I'll choose Fahrenheit for the unit.<br><br>So I'll call 'get_current_weather' with city: 'New York City', state: 'NY', and unit: 'fahrenheit'. <br><br>I should make sure to format the function calls correctly. For the date, it's <function= get_current_date '{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}' because the parameters need to be a JSON object with the key as the function argument name and the value as the argument. Wait, no, the function call syntax requires the parameters to be in the JSON format. So it should be {\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"} inside the function call. <br><br>Similarly, for the weather, the parameters will be {\"city\": \"New York City\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}. <br><br>I think that's all. So the user can get both the date and time in New York and the weather there using these two function calls. I should mention that the functions will return the data, so the user can see it immediately. <br><br>I should also remind them to execute the code to see the results. Yeah, that makes sense. Let me put it all together.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York City\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" for context. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in lowercase and use underscores for readability. So, \"city\" becomes \"city\", \"population\" becomes \"population\", and \"country\" as \"country\". \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object would have the city as \"Paris\", the population as 3500000, and the country as \"France\". I\\'ll format it properly with commas and brackets to ensure it\\'s valid JSON.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need more details, like the exact year of the population figure or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the population, I\\'ll stick to that. \\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it\\'s correctly formatted so the user can easily read and use it.\\n</think>{\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 369, 2266, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 42047, 323, 990, 71790, 369, 91494, 13, 2055, 11, 330, 8926, 1, 9044, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 1, 9044, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 330, 11141, 1, 438, 330, 11141, 3263, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1633, 1035, 614, 279, 3283, 438, 330, 59604, 497, 279, 7042, 438, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 438, 330, 49000, 3263, 358, 3278, 3561, 432, 10277, 448, 76602, 323, 38929, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 4718, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 421, 279, 1196, 2578, 1184, 803, 3565, 11, 1075, 279, 4734, 1042, 315, 279, 7042, 7071, 476, 5107, 13142, 13, 1988, 2474, 807, 1172, 4588, 369, 279, 7042, 11, 358, 3278, 9214, 311, 429, 13, 4710, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2797, 323, 63594, 11566, 11, 3259, 2704, 432, 594, 12440, 23126, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 1349, 323, 990, 432, 624, 151649, 4913, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'b4c7d62c773d4fd4863681abb7ee749c', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 395, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 5.144375562667847}}\n"

I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" for context. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in lowercase and use underscores for readability. So, \"city\" becomes \"city\", \"population\" becomes \"population\", and \"country\" as \"country\". <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON object would have the city as \"Paris\", the population as 3500000, and the country as \"France\". I'll format it properly with commas and brackets to ensure it's valid JSON.<br><br>I should also consider if the user might need more details, like the exact year of the population figure or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's correctly formatted so the user can easily read and use it.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I know the capital is Paris, so I need to provide accurate stats on that. Let me think about the population. I remember that Paris is a major city and its population is quite large. I think the latest data is from 2021, and I believe it\\'s around 2.2 million. But wait, I should confirm that to be sure. \\n\\nNow, what other details should I include? The country is France, so that\\'s straightforward. Paris\\'s administrative region is a DOM (Dependency administrative commune), which I think is Paris市. I need to make sure about that. The population data is usually grouped into urban, suburban, and rural areas, so I should mention each separately, maybe around 2.1 million, 300,000, and 193,200 respectively. \\n\\nWhen I put this into JSON, I should structure it clearly. Maybe use an \"info\" key with a \"capital\" subkey that contains all the details. Then, a \"population\" key with \"urban,\" \"suburban,\" and \"rural\" populations. The data should be accurate but note that projections can change, so it\\'s good to mention that. \\n\\nI should make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets. I\\'ll write it out and double-check for any syntax errors. Also, I need to ensure the timestamps are accurate and include decimals for precision. \\n\\nWait, I\\'m not entirely sure about the current population estimates. I might have seen more recent data suggesting it\\'s around 2.22 million for urban, but I should verify that. To be cautious, I\\'ll note that projections can vary between sources. \\n\\nAlright, putting it all together. The JSON should have a \"country\" field pointing to \"France,\" \"capital\" as \"Paris,\" \"administrativeRegion\" as Paris市, and the population areas with their respective numbers. Also, a small note about projections at the end. I think that\\'s everything the user needs.\\n</think>\\n\\nhere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"administrativeRegion\": \"Paris市\",\\n    \"population\": {\\n      \"urban\": 2127000,\\n      \"suburban\": 270000,\\n      \"rural\": 193200\\n    },\\n    \"timestamp\": \"latest available population data (2021)\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON includes the population of Paris split into urban, suburban, and rural areas.
