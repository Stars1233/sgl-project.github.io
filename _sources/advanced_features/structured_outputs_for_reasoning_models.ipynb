    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '3555bdbf30ea41c380b2da58a8863e26', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.0130579471588135}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what the exact question is. They want the population of Paris, the capital, so that\\'s straightforward.\\n\\nI should also consider what other information they might need. Maybe they want location details, so including longitude and latitude could be helpful. Access points like Wikipedia and cánons.com are commonly used sites, so I\\'ll include those as reliability sources.\\n\\nNow, for the population figure. I think the current estimate is around 2.1 million as of 2023. But I should make sure to mention that this can change over time due to various factors like births, deaths, and migration. It\\'s also a good idea to advise them to check the latest data from official sources because population statistics can fluctuate.\\n\\nFormatting it into JSON, I need to structure it properly with the correct keys: \"capital\" for the city, \"country\" for France, \" Coordinates\" for longitude and latitude, \"Population\" with the number and a note about the estimate and updates, and \"Sources\" for the reliable websites they can refer to.\\n\\nI should keep the JSON valid by ensuring correct syntax, like commas in the right places and proper quotation marks.

      "\n",
      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user's query. They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should recall that the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty much a given, but I can double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Paris is indeed the administrative capital, though sometimes people confuse it with Lyon, but no, Paris is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user is asking for population data. I remember that the population of a city can change over time due to various factors like births, deaths, and migration. I think the number given is an approximate figure. I recall that in recent years, Paris has had a population around 2 million, but I should verify if that's current or if it's outdated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think the population might have been updated more recently. Let me think... I believe it's around 2.17 million as of 2021. That seems about right. I should make sure to use that number to be accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the user wants the information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. So I'll structure it with a key-value pair where the key is \"capital\" and the value is another object containing \"city\" and \"population\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": {\n",
      "    \"city\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "    \"population\": 2170000\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there's any additional information the user might find useful, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. I don't think they need any references or sources, so I'll omit that to keep it concise.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure that the population number is presented accurately. Since I'm recalling it as 2,170,000, I'll write it with commas for readability inside the JSON.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, in JSON, numbers don't have commas. So it should be 2170000 without commas. So the correct JSON would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": {\n",
      "    \"city\": \"Paris\",\n",
