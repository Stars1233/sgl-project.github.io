    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes.

For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

Let me start by recalling the functions available: get_current_weather and get_current_date.<br><br>First, I'll tackle the weather. The get_current_weather function requires a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, which I know is NY, so the state should be 'NY'. The unit can be either 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'; I'll choose 'fahrenheit' since that's what I'm more familiar with.<br><br>So, I'll call get_current_weather with city: 'New York', state: 'NY', and unit: 'fahrenheit'. I'll need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted as a JSON object.<br><br>Next, for the date and time, I'll use get_current_date, which takes a timezone parameter. New York is in the 'America/New_York' timezone. So, I'll call get_current_date with timezone: 'America/New_York'.<br><br>I should make sure to format each function call correctly, each on its own line, using the specified syntax with start_tag, parameters, and end_tag. Also, I need to remember to include the source of the information, even if it's just a function call.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll send two separate function calls: one for the weather and another for the date and time, each following the required format. I'll make sure each starts and ends with the right tags and that the parameters are correctly specified within JSON brackets.<br><br>I don't think I need to combine these into one function since they are separate requests. Each function call should be handled individually to ensure accuracy. I also need to ensure that all required parameters are provided for each function to avoid any errors.<br><br>Let me double-check the parameters for each function. For get_current_weather, 'city', 'state', and 'unit' are all required. For get_current_date, 'timezone' is required. I have all the necessary information, so the function calls should work as intended.<br><br>Finally, I'll format each function call correctly, making sure there's no markdown and each is on its own line.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. The capital of France is definitely Paris. I should start by confirming that to make sure I\\'m providing accurate data.\\n\\nNext, I need to figure out what specific details the user wants. They mentioned \"information and population,\" which is a bit vague. I think they\\'re looking for key facts about Paris\\'s population, maybe including the current figure, average growth rate, and age demographics. That makes sense because population details like this are commonly sought after.\\n\\nI should also consider the user\\'s intent. They might be a student working on a project, someone planning a visit, or maybe a researcher. Each scenario might require different data. For instance, a student might need the growth rate for a class project, while a researcher could focus on demographic breakdowns.\\n\\nNow, I need to look up the latest data on Paris\\'s population. As of now, the population is around 2,168,007 people. It\\'s important to note that this is an estimate and can change over time due to births, deaths, and migrations.\\n\\nLooking into the demographic distribution, Paris has a relatively young population, with 35% under 30 years old. That\\'s a common trend in many urban areas. I should include this information for thoroughness.\\n\\nFor the growth rate, a slight decrease of 0.09% is typical and shows that while the city is aging a bit, it\\'s still managing to grow slowly. Including this helps users understand the trend over time.\\n\\nAge demographics break it down into different age groups. A large percentage, about 28%, are between 20 and 39 years old. This is the peak age group contributing to the workforce. Only 11% are over the age of 65, which is on the lower end compared to, say, Tokyo or other aging populations.\\n\\n thoughtful about the user\\'s deep needs, they might also be interested in context, like how Paris compares internationally. This might help them place the population numbers into a global perspective.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with a \"name\" field for the capital, followed by \"population,\" which includes the current count, growth rate, and demographics broken down into age groups. This format makes it easy to read and extract specific information.\\n\\nI should double-check all the numbers to ensure accuracy. Populations can fluctuate yearly due to various factors, so updating sources is important.
