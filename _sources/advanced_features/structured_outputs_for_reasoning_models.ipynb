    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations.

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

I should make sure to include accurate details about Paris. Let me think about the key points: name, country, location, and population. \\n\\nWait, they want a JSON format, so I need to structure it properly. I\\'ll create a main object with a \"name\" key, and then a \"capital\" key that\\'s another object containing country, location, and population. That should organize the info neatly.\\n\\nThe population can be approximate since exact numbers change. I recall that Paris has around 2.1 million people, but it\\'s growing. Including the city\\'s economy might add more relevant info, like being a global hub and having a GDP figure. \\n\\nAlso, mentioning Paris\\'s significance in culture and landmarks would provide a comprehensive overview. I need to double-check the population to ensure it\\'s up-to-date, but I think the current estimate is close to the number I\\'ll use. \\n\\nAlright, putting it all together in JSON, making sure it\\'s clear and easy to read.

      "Generated text: Alright, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to figure out what exactly the user is asking for. The capital of France is Paris, so that's the key piece of information here. They want both general info and the population, which I should present in a structured JSON format.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should start by gathering accurate data. Paris is indeed the capital, so that's straightforward. For the population, as of the latest data, it's around 2.1 million. However, I should note that this number can change due to factors like births, deaths, and migration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, structuring this into JSON. I'll need to create an object with two main keys: \"capital_info\" and \"population.\" Under \"capital_info,\" I can include the name, nickname, location, and whether it's the capital. For \"population,\" I'll provide the current estimate and mention that it's approximate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also need to think about the user's intent. They might be using this data for a project, report, or maybe just general knowledge. Including the population as an approximate figure is important because exact numbers can vary and depend on the source and time of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I should consider if the user might need more detailed data, like historical population trends or projections. But since they specifically asked for the current population, I'll stick to that unless I can infer they want more details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, making sure the JSON is properly formatted so it's valid and can be easily parsed if needed. I'll double-check the syntax to avoid any errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the necessary fields, ensuring clarity and accuracy. I'll also add a note about the population being approximate to avoid giving false information.\n",
