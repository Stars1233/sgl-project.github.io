    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets.

They mentioned two things: current date and time, and weather. <br><br>First, I need to figure out which functions to use. From the provided functions, there's 'get_current_date' and 'get_current_weather'. I remember that 'get_current_date' requires a timezone parameter, which is perfect because the user is in New York. <br><br>I should structure the function calls step by step. I'll start with 'get_current_date' and specify the timezone as 'America/New_York'. That will give me the date and time in their local time zone. <br><br>Next, I'll call 'get_current_weather' with the city as 'New York' and the unit as 'fahrenheit' since the user didn't specify the unit. This will provide the temperature in the format they're expecting. <br><br>I have to make sure each function call is within its own start and end tags, and that I only use one function at a time. Also, I need to include the parameters correctly in JSON format. <br><br>Putting it all together, I'll send two separate function calls: one for the date and time, and another for the weather. Each will have their own start and end tags with the appropriate parameters. <br><br>I should also remember to add the sources from the functions so the user knows where the information comes from. That way, it's transparent and trustworthy. <br><br>Double-checking everything, I think that's all I need to do. The user should get both the date and time in New York and the weather forecast for their location.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First off, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s something I remember from history class. Now, I need to find out the current population of Paris. \\n\\nI think the population might have changed over the years. I remember reading somewhere that it fluctuates based on birth rates, deaths, and migrations. I believe the last census was a few years back, maybe 2020? I should check whether that\\'s the most recent data available or if there\\'s a more recent estimate.\\n\\nI recall that cities like Paris have seen population growth over the decades, especially as a tourist destination, which might affect the numbers. But I\\'m not entirely sure about the exact figure. I don\\'t want to use outdated information, so I should look for a recent source or official statistics.\\n\\nLooking up the population, I see that the latest census from 2020 estimates Paris\\'s population to be around 2.17 million people. That seems reasonable. I should verify this with a reliable source, like the official website of the French National Statistical Institute, to confirm the data.\\n\\nNow, structuring this information into JSON format. I know JSON uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll need a key for the capital and another for the population. I\\'ll put everything inside square brackets and separate the keys with commas.\\n\\nSo, the JSON structure should look like this:\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2170000\\n}\\n\\nWait, should I include a decimal point for the population? Since the number is an integer, it\\'s fine to leave it as 2170000 without a decimal. That makes the data clean and precise.\\n\\nI should also make sure the syntax is correct, using double quotes for keys and keeping the commas in the right places. Missing a comma could make the JSON invalid, so I\\'ll double-check that.\\n\\nIn summary, I determined the capital is Paris, checked the recent population data as of 2020, and formatted it correctly into JSON without any errors.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2170000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 633, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 5512, 1007, 11, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 13, 2938, 594, 2494, 358, 6099, 504, 3840, 536, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 700, 279, 1482, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 279, 7042, 2578, 614, 5497, 916, 279, 1635, 13, 358, 6099, 5290, 14696, 429, 432, 38288, 50985, 3118, 389, 7194, 7813, 11, 16375, 11, 323, 17063, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 1537, 43602, 572, 264, 2421, 1635, 1182, 11, 7196, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 30, 358, 1265, 1779, 3425, 429, 594, 279, 1429, 3213, 821, 2500, 476, 421, 1052, 594, 264, 803, 3213, 16045, 382, 40, 19091, 429, 9720, 1075, 12095, 614, 3884, 7042, 6513, 916, 279, 10793, 11, 5310, 438, 264, 29970, 9106, 11, 892, 2578, 7802, 279, 5109, 13, 1988, 358, 2776, 537, 11368, 2704, 911, 279, 4734, 7071, 13, 358, 1513, 944, 1366, 311, 990, 40526, 1995, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 1401, 369, 264, 3213, 2530, 476, 3946, 13142, 382, 22464, 705, 279, 7042, 11, 358, 1490, 429, 279, 5535, 43602, 504, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 17530, 12095, 594, 7042, 311, 387, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 22, 3526, 1251, 13, 2938, 4977, 13276, 13, 358, 1265, 10146, 419, 448, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 1075, 279, 3946, 3910, 315, 279, 8585, 5055, 65694, 9976, 11, 311, 7683, 279, 821, 382, 7039, 11, 2036, 1677, 419, 1995, 1119, 4718, 3561, 13, 358, 1414, 4718, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1184, 264, 1376, 369, 279, 6722, 323, 2441, 369, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 3278, 2182, 4297, 4766, 9334, 38929, 323, 8651, 279, 6894, 448, 76602, 382, 4416, 11, 279, 4718, 5944, 1265, 1401, 1075, 419, 510, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 630, 14190, 11, 1265, 358, 2924, 264, 12122, 1459, 369, 279, 7042, 30, 8704, 279, 1372, 374, 458, 7546, 11, 432, 594, 6915, 311, 5274, 432, 438, 220, 17, 16, 22, 15, 15, 15, 15, 2041, 264, 12122, 13, 2938, 3643, 279, 821, 4240, 323, 23560, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 1281, 2704, 279, 19482, 374, 4396, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 6894, 323, 10282, 279, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 35264, 264, 31683, 1410, 1281, 279, 4718, 8318, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1990, 15934, 429, 382, 641, 12126, 11, 358, 10838, 279, 6722, 374, 12095, 11, 10067, 279, 3213, 7042, 821, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 11, 323, 23126, 432, 12440, 1119, 4718, 2041, 894, 5975, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '5646ce0c1a0f41a29defbcaec2542fbd', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 473, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.3142809867858887}}</strong>"
