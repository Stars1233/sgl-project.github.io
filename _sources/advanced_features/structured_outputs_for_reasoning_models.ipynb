    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

That should give me the current date and time in that location.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I'll use 'get_current_weather' with the city as 'New York' and state as 'NY'.

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'b7998898845248f7925ee3c86c44d259', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.358372926712036}}</strong>"

Hmm, the capital of France is Paris, right? I need to make sure I get that right. \\n\\nFirst, I should figure out what kind of information and population data they\\'re looking for. They might be an student working on a project or maybe just someone curious. Either way, clarity is important. I should present the information in a clear and concise way.\\n\\nI know Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the latest numbers. I should probably check a reliable source to confirm. Oh wait, I remember from some statistics that the population was about 2,158,000 in 2018, but growth rates are increasing, so the current number might be higher. Maybe around 2,276,000? I think that\\'s the latest I came across.\\n\\nNow, regarding the demographics, Paris has a high concentration of young people, especially students and workers. The population is mainly French, but there are also many immigrants from various countries. That\\'s something that\\'s probably relevant for the user, especially if they\\'re doing cross-cultural studies or something.\\n\\nThe economic aspect is another key point. Paris is a major financial and cultural hub, so including information about its industries and economic sectors would be useful. I should mention specific sectors like finance, tourism, and services to give them a comprehensive view.\\n\\nPutting this all into a JSON structure, I\\'ll need to organize the data appropriately. Maybe separate the main facts and then add sections for demographics, population growth, and economic info. That way, the JSON is easy to read and extract information from.\\n\\nLet me structure it step by step. Main facts will include the population, year data, and key stats about the city. Then, demographics will cover age, ethnic groups, and language. Population growth will explain the growth rates and projections. Lastly, the economic sections will detail the major industries and tourism.\\n\\nI should also make sure the JSON is valid and correctly formatted. Using proper syntax, commas in the right places, and ensuring that each key is correctly spelled and capitalized. Maybe using emojis as visual separators would make it more engaging and easier to parse.\\n\\nWait, the user specifically asked for JSON, so I need to avoid markdown and keep it clean. Also, since they might be using it for something like a project or a report, accuracy is crucial. I should double-check all the numbers to prevent any errors in the data they receive.\\n\\nIn summary, the response should be a well-structured JSON with accurate and relevant information about Paris, its population, demographics, and economy. Making sure it\\'s clear and easy to understand is key so the user can get exactly what they need without any confusion.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the JSON format containing the information and estimated population of the capital of France (Paris):\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"current\": 2158000,\\n    \"year\": 2018,\\n    \"next_two_years\": \"Population is expected to grow by approximately 1% annually in the coming years\"\\n  },\\n  \"main_facts\": {\\n    \"area\": \"105.5 square kilometers\",\\n    \"year_founded\": 1352,\\n    \"population_density\": \"around 20 people per square meter\",\\n    \"economic_sectors\": \"Finance, tourism, education, and cultural industries are prominent.\"\\n  },\\n  \"demographics\": {\\n    \"age_distribution\": {\\n      \"younger\": \"65% of the population under 30 years old\",\\n      \"middle-aged\": \"25% between 30 and 64 years old\",\\n      \"oldest\": \"10% over 65 years old\"\\n    },\\n    \"ethnic_groups\": \"A diverse population with French as the majority language, followed by various immigrant communities and minority groups.\",\\n    \"language\": \"French is the official language, and the capital is known for its vibrant cultural scene.\"\\n  },\\n  \"population_growth\": {\\n    \"growth_rate\": \"Annual population growth rate of about 0.8%\",\\n    \"sources_of_growth\": \"Births, immigration, and emigration are key factors.\"\\n  },\\n  \"economic_info\": {\\n    \"main_sectors\": \"1.

      "Generated text: Alright, the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, the capital is Paris, so that's the key point here. I need to make sure I include the correct population. Let me think, the population figure I remember is around 2.1 million, but I should double-check that to be accurate. Maybe I should look up the latest data to ensure it's up-to-date. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but sometimes population numbers can vary based on the source and the year. I should use a reliable source, like the official data from the government or a reputable statistical database. Okay, checking the latest records, it seems the population is approximately 2,154,306 as of 2023. That's pretty close to 2.1 million. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, structuring this in JSON. I think the user wants a clean and organized format, so using an object with the country name as a key and the information as another key makes sense. Including the population under a \"population\" sub-key would make it clear. I should also ensure that the numbers are formatted correctly, using commas for readability. \n",
      "\n",
      "I need to present this in a clear message, so the user knows that the data is accurate and up-to-date. Maybe I'll add a note saying that the population figure is approximate and based on the latest available data. That way, the user is informed about the source and any potential variations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include any additional information, like the percentage change from the previous census? The user didn't specify, but providing a bit more context might be helpful. So I'll mention that the population is up 0.5% from the 2019 figure. That gives the user a sense of growth over time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me structure the JSON properly. The main object will have a \"country\" key with the value \"France,\" and then a \"capital\" key that's another object containing \"name\" and \"population.\" The population number should be a string with commas for clarity. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and brackets. No trailing commas can be allowed, so I'll have to be careful with that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the response should be straightforward and easy to read. I think the user just needs the information quickly, so keeping it concise but informative is key. They might be using this data for a report, a project, or maybe just general knowledge. Either way, providing accurate and clear information is important. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if the user might need this in a different format, but since they specifically asked for JSON, I'll stick to that. Maybe in the future, I can offer to provide it in another format if needed. For now, focusing on JSON is the way to go. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, time to compose the JSON. I'll structure it with proper indentation for readability, even though it's JSON, but that's a good practice. Let me make sure the keys are in lowercase as that's standard in JSON objects. \n",
      "\n",
