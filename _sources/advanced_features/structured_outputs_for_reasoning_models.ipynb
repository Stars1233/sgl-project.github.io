    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '6ee76c064a524b62a240400b69a82b8d', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.515544891357422}}</strong>"

First, I need to remember that the capital of France is Paris. The population varies each year, so I should check the most recent data available. I recall that as of the latest estimates, Paris has a population around 2 million people. It\\'s important to note that this number can change due to births, deaths, and migration. I should also consider including relevant metadata, such as the source of the population data, and perhaps some additional facts about Paris to provide a comprehensive answer. The user requested the information in JSON, so I\\'ll structure it accordingly, making sure the keys are accurate and the values are up-to-date.\\n\\nI should also think about why the user is asking this. They might be doing research, preparing a presentation, or working on a project that requires current demographic data. Knowing this, it\\'s good to ensure the information is reliable and precise. Additionally, providing the data in a structured format like JSON helps in easy access and integration into other applications if needed. Maybe the user is a student, a researcher, or someone creating content related to France\\'s capital. In any case, clarity and accuracy are key, so I\\'ll make sure to present the information clearly with all necessary details.\\n</think>\\n\\nSure!

Now, I'm trying to remember or find out what the population of Paris is. I think it's a really big city, so the population should be in the millions. I've heard numbers around 2 million before, but I'm not entirely certain if that's correct. Maybe I should check some sources or think about recent data. I know that population figures can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. I think in recent years, Paris has been growing a bit, so the population might be a little higher than 2 million. But I'm not sure exactly how much higher. I'll stick with 2 million for now, but I'm a bit uncertain if that's the current number or an older estimate.\n",
