    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array.

Let me figure out how to approach this step by step.<br><br>First, I need to determine which functions to use. The user mentioned they want the date and time, so I should use the get_current_date function. This function requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I'll set the timezone to 'America/New_York'.<br><br>Next, for the weather, the get_current_weather function is needed. This function requires a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, but I need to find the correct two-letter state abbreviation. New York is NY, so the state parameter will be 'NY'. The unit should be in Fahrenheit since the user didn't specify, so I'll set unit to 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>Now, I need to structure these function calls correctly. I'll handle them one at a time to avoid confusion. First, I'll call get_current_date with the timezone parameter. Then, I'll call get_current_weather with city, state, and unit parameters. I'll make sure each function call is on a separate line with the correct format, including the start_tag and end_tag as specified.<br><br>I should also mention the sources in the response, so I'll include the OpenWeatherMap for the weather and Time区 for the timezone information. This way, the user knows where the information comes from.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write out each function call separately, ensuring that all required parameters are included and formatted correctly. This should provide the user with the current date, time, and weather in a clear and concise manner.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function>  <br><br>Sources:  <br>- OpenWeatherMap for weather data  <br>- Time区 for timezone information</strong>"

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

Hmm, okay, let me break this down. \\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out what exactly the user is asking for. The capital of France is Paris, so that\\'s clear. They want both general information about it and its population. JSON format is pretty straightforward, but I should make sure the structure is correct.\\n\\nI should start by recalling the key facts about Paris. It\\'s the political, cultural, and economic center of France. I should include some notable landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and Notre-Dame. Transport features like the metro and RER are important, as well as major landmarks like Versailles and the City of Light, which refers to hectares of light in the city.\\n\\nNow, regarding the population. I know that population figures change over time, especially with migration. In 2022 and 2023, Paris had around 3.5 million people in 2022, with a slight increase. But since that\\'s a recent year, maybe I should stick to the latest available data to be accurate. I\\'ll say approximately 3.5 million in 2023, acknowledging that it can vary slightly depending on the source.\\n\\nI should structure this information in a JSON format. The user specifically asked for JSON, so I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" key, set to \"Paris\". Under that, an \"info\" key containing the general information, and a \"population\" key with the number and the year it\\'s from. \\n\\nI need to ensure the JSON syntax is correct—proper commas, quotes, and braces. Also, since the user might be using this data for a project or report, accuracy is key. I\\'ll double-check the population figure to make sure it\\'s up to date and reliable.\\n\\nPutting it all together, my JSON should look clean and be easy to parse. I\\'ll make each key clear and label the population with the year, so the user knows when the data was current. I think that\\'s all. The user didn\\'t specify needing more details, so I\\'ll keep it concise but informative.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"info\": {\\n    \"general\": \"Paris is the capital city of France.
