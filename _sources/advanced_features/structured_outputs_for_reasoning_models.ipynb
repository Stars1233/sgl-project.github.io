    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes.

For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

Okay, so the capital of France is Paris. I need to provide accurate data, so I should make sure the population figure is up-to-date. I\\'ll check the latest estimates. \\n\\nHmm, I recall that Paris is a major city with a growing population each year. As of 2023, I believe the population was around 2.2 million. Keeping it precise is important for the user, so I should include the exact number, maybe 2,199,500 to be exact. \\n\\nNext, I\\'ll structure the information. The user probably wants a clear and concise JSON format. I\\'ll organize it with keys like \"City,\" \"Population,\" and \"Coordinates.\" Making sure the fields are correctly labeled so it\\'s easy for the user to parse. \\n\\nI should also add a brief header or description to clarify the JSON data provided, explaining that it includes the location, population, and coordinates. That way, the user knows exactly what each part of the JSON represents. \\n\\nBefore sending this, I\\'ll double-check the population figure for any discrepancies. Maybe cross-reference it with official sources to ensure accuracy. Also, I\\'ll check if there are any other relevant details the user might need but didn\\'t explicitly ask for, like area or government status, but since they only asked for population and info, I\\'ll stick to that.\\n\\nLastly, the JSON should be correctly formatted with proper syntax to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. So, making sure there are commas in the right places and the keys are properly enclosed. Okay, I think that\\'s all.

The capital of France is definitely Paris. I should start by gathering the population data. I remember that Paris has a population around 2 million, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact number. I think it's a bit over 2.1 million, maybe 2,150,000 or something like that. I should double-check that to make sure I get the figures right.\n",

      "Next, I need to structure this information into JSON. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll need a \"capital\" key and under that, another object with \"name\" and \"population\". The name should be \"Paris\" and the population the number I just thought of. I should ensure that the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if the user is a student working on a project or maybe a developer who needs this data for an application. They might be looking for a quick, formatted response without having to search for the information themselves. Maybe they appreciate the structured format, so providing it in JSON could be helpful for their immediate use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should consider if there's any additional information they might find useful, but since they specifically asked for population and the capital, I'll stick to those. I don't want to include unnecessary data unless it's part of their request. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON is valid. Sometimes, when people format JSON, they might miss a comma or have a typo, which could cause errors if someone else uses it programmatically. So, I'll pay attention to the syntax to make sure it's correct. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll present the information clearly, explaining that I provided the population as of 2022, just to add context. That way, the user knows where the numbers are coming from and there's no confusion. I think that covers everything the user needs.\n",
