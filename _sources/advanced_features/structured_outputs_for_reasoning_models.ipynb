    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

No, I'm pretty sure France's capital is Paris. Maybe I should double-check that to be certain. Yeah, Paris is where the government is located, and that's the capital.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '97b10c4548064190ba323c3b3b68e4aa', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.188667058944702}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to help the user by providing the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, the capital of France is Paris, right? That\\'s pretty well-known, but maybe I should double-check to make sure I\\'m correct. I think I remember learning in school that Paris is both the capital and the largest city in France, but I\\'m not 100% sure. Maybe I should confirm that, just to be safe.\\n\\nNow, onto the population. I\\'m not exactly sure about the current number, but I know it\\'s a big city. I think it\\'s in the millions. Maybe around 2 million? But wait, I recall that the population of Paris has been increasing over the years. I think it was closer to 2.1 million when I last heard. Let me see if I can remember any specific data points. I think in recent years, maybe 2018 or something, they said approximately 2.15 million. I\\'m not certain if that\\'s the exact figure, but it\\'s a reasonable estimate based on what I remember.\\n\\nThe user asked for the information and population in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. So I need to put the information into a JSON object. The capital is Paris, France, so that\\'s straightforward. The population is a numerical value, approximately 2.15 million. I should probably round it to one decimal place for simplicity, so 2.15 million.\\n\\nWait, but should I include units? The user just asked for the population number, so maybe just the number without units is okay. However, including the word \"million\" might make it clearer, but perhaps it\\'s better to just have the number and specify the unit in the text.\\n\\nLet me structure the JSON. I think it should have a key for the name and a key for the population. So the object would look like {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. Alternatively, since 2150000 is a bit long, maybe I can write it as 2.15 million inside the JSON, but JSON doesn\\'t handle variables, so it\\'s just a number. So the JSON would be {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}.\\n\\nI should also consider if there are any other details the user might want, but they only asked for the capital and population, so I guess that\\'s all for the JSON. Maybe I should double-check the current population, just to be accurate. Let me think... I believe the population has been increasing, so 2.15 million seems a bit old. Maybe the latest data is a bit higher, but without exact current figures, I\\'ll go with the number I have.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object would be:\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}\\n\\nThat should meet the user\\'s request accurately based on my knowledge.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 1492, 279, 1196, 553, 8241, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 11, 1290, 30, 2938, 594, 5020, 1632, 21309, 11, 714, 7196, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 311, 1281, 2704, 358, 2776, 4396, 13, 358, 1744, 358, 6099, 6832, 304, 2906, 429, 12095, 374, 2176, 279, 6722, 323, 279, 7772, 3283, 304, 9625, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 220, 16, 15, 15, 4, 2704, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 7683, 429, 11, 1101, 311, 387, 6092, 382, 7039, 11, 8630, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 911, 279, 1482, 1372, 11, 714, 358, 1414, 432, 594, 264, 2409, 3283, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 304, 279, 11728, 13, 10696, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 30, 1988, 3783, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7703, 916, 279, 1635, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 572, 12128, 311, 220, 17, 13, 16, 3526, 979, 358, 1537, 6617, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 421, 358, 646, 6099, 894, 3151, 821, 3501, 13, 358, 1744, 304, 3213, 1635, 11, 7196, 220, 17, 15, 16, 23, 476, 2494, 11, 807, 1053, 13187, 220, 17, 13, 16, 20, 3526, 13, 358, 2776, 537, 3654, 421, 429, 594, 279, 4734, 7071, 11, 714, 432, 594, 264, 13276, 16045, 3118, 389, 1128, 358, 6099, 382, 785, 1196, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 13352, 369, 12914, 3002, 2806, 367, 11, 892, 374, 264, 1616, 311, 5944, 821, 13, 2055, 358, 1184, 311, 2182, 279, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 576, 6722, 374, 12095, 11, 9625, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 576, 7042, 374, 264, 34776, 897, 11, 13187, 220, 17, 13, 16, 20, 3526, 13, 358, 1265, 4658, 4778, 432, 311, 825, 12122, 1992, 369, 38975, 11, 773, 220, 17, 13, 16, 20, 3526, 382, 14190, 11, 714, 1265, 358, 2924, 8153, 30, 576, 1196, 1101, 4588, 369, 279, 7042, 1372, 11, 773, 7196, 1101, 279, 1372, 2041, 8153, 374, 16910, 13, 4354, 11, 2670, 279, 3409, 330, 58313, 1, 2578, 1281, 432, 48379, 11, 714, 8365, 432, 594, 2664, 311, 1101, 614, 279, 1372, 323, 13837, 279, 4982, 304, 279, 1467, 382, 10061, 752, 5944, 279, 4718, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 1265, 614, 264, 1376, 369, 279, 829, 323, 264, 1376, 369, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 279, 1633, 1035, 1401, 1075, 5212, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 7810, 38478, 11, 2474, 220, 17, 16, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 374, 264, 2699, 1293, 11, 7196, 358, 646, 3270, 432, 438, 220, 17, 13, 16, 20, 3526, 4766, 279, 4718, 11, 714, 4718, 3171, 944, 3705, 7332, 11, 773, 432, 594, 1101, 264, 1372, 13, 2055, 279, 4718, 1035, 387, 5212, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 421, 1052, 525, 894, 1008, 3565, 279, 1196, 2578, 1366, 11, 714, 807, 1172, 4588, 369, 279, 6722, 323, 7042, 11, 773, 358, 7942, 429, 594, 678, 369, 279, 4718, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 279, 1482, 7042, 11, 1101, 311, 387, 13382, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 1112, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 702, 1012, 7703, 11, 773, 220, 17, 13, 16, 20, 3526, 4977, 264, 2699, 2310, 13, 10696, 279, 5535, 821, 374, 264, 2699, 5080, 11, 714, 2041, 4734, 1482, 12396, 11, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 279, 1372, 358, 614, 382, 4416, 11, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1633, 1035, 387, 510, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 630, 4792, 1265, 3367, 279, 1196, 594, 1681, 29257, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '34249038032249c48e6b6f65275c5480', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 664, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.081408500671387}}</strong>"
