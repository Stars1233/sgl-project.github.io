    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'b28dfa7013ae49e3b3c2a203b1608634', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.339240312576294}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': \"Okay, so I need to figure out the population of the capital of France, which is Paris. First off, I know that Paris is a major city and has a pretty large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. I remember it's over 30 million, but I'm not certain if it's 32 or 30 or something else. \\n\\nI think I've heard somewhere that Paris is one of the most populous cities in the European Union. Maybe I can recall some other capitals and their populations to get a ballpark figure. For example, I know that Angela Merkel is the Chancellor of Germany, and Berlin has a population around 3.7 million. Lyon is another city in France with about 1.1 million people. So, if Paris is bigger than that, maybe it's in the 30 million range.\\n\\nI also remember that France's total population is around 40 million, so if the country has 40 million people, and major cities like Paris, Lyon, and Marseille are about a fifth of that, maybe Paris alone is about 15% of 40 million. Let me do a quick calculation: 40 million times 0.15 is 6 million, but that doesn't seem right because I think Paris has way more people than that. Maybe I shouldn't take the country's total population and assume Paris is a certain percentage because there are other cities contributing as well. \\n\\nWait, maybe I can think about it differently. I know that Paris is much bigger than the other capitals I mentioned. For example, Rome has about 2.8 million, and Tokyo has about 3.4 million. So, Paris being approximately three times those numbers—30 million sounds plausible. \\n\\nI might also consider recent data. I think population figures can change based on births, deaths, and migration. If there have been recent increases, the population might be a bit higher. But I'm not sure how much higher. Maybe around 32-34 million? \\n\\nI should also check if Paris is the most populous city in France. I believe it is, but sometimes smaller cities can be just as populous. Still, in terms of metropolitan area, Paris has a much higher population. For example, the metropolitan area of Paris is around 12 million, but the urban area might be higher. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me correct that—it's actually the opposite; the urban area is smaller, and the metropolitan area is larger. So the metropolitan area might include other towns, making the total higher.\\n\\nI think the most up-to-date figure I can recall is around 32 million. But I'm not 100% sure because I might be mixing it up with other cities. To verify, I could think about other major cities like London, which is around 9 million. So if Paris is more than three times that, it's in the right ballpark. \\n\\nAlternatively, I might recall that the population figure was around 32.5 million last year. That could be a more precise estimate. I also think about how Paris has grown over the years due to tourism and economic activities, which helps draw more residents. \\n\\nIn some sources, I remember seeing that Paris's population is just under 33 million, maybe 32.4 million. That sounds accurate.

      "Generated text: Alright, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's a fact I remember from basic geography. Now, I need to find the population of Paris. I think the population numbers can vary depending on the source and the time of year. I recall that Paris is one of the most populous cities in the world, maybe around 2 million people. But to be accurate, I should check a reliable source or a recent statistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact number. I think it's been increasing over the years due to urbanization. Maybe around 2.1 million? I'll go with that for now. I should also make sure to include the units, so it's clear that the population is in thousands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a way to structure data. I need to create an object with a key for the city name and another key for the population. The population should probably be an integer to represent the exact number.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, the JSON object should look something like this: { \"City\": \"Paris\", \"Population\": 2100000 }. That should satisfy the user's request. I should double-check the population number to ensure it's up to date, but since I'm not a real-time data source, I'll stick with the number I have.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the user might be using this data for a project or a presentation, so accuracy is important. They might also appreciate if I mention that the population figure is approximate. But since they specifically asked for JSON, I'll focus on that without adding extra text unless they ask for more details.\n",
