    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

Hmm, the capital is Paris, right?\\n\\nFirst, I should figure out what specific details they\\'re looking for. They mentioned \"information,\" which could mean a variety of things—like administrative details, historical facts, or maybe general data. Population is definitely one part, but the user wants it in JSON, so I need to structure the response accordingly.\\n\\nWait, I should check the current population of Paris. It\\'s good to provide accurate numbers, but I also need to remember that population figures change over time. Maybe give both the approximate current number and perhaps the recent figure to give a clear picture.\\n\\nNext, formatting this data into JSON. The user specified JSON, so I\\'ll need to make sure the structure is correct. Perhaps an array with different categories, each containing relevant information. Category 1 could be general info, Category 2 could be historical context, Category 3 might include current and growth stats, and Category 4 could cover the metropolitan area or commuting zone.\\n\\nI should include the area of Paris in square kilometers and mention that it\\'s often referred to by other names, like the Île-de-France region. Also, touching on Paris\\'s rich history, like its status as a capital and the Eiffel Tower, could add depth.\\n\\nThe population number has been changing. As of 2023, the population is around 2 million. Some sources mention it\\'s about 2,100,000, while others might have slightly different numbers. It\\'s probably best to use a recent figure and include a note about the fluctuations.\\n\\nI should also mention that the metropolitan area is over 3 million people, which gives a broader context. Including historical context about Paris as the capital for over 800 years and mentions of its strategic location could be useful for the user.\\n\\nOverall, the response should be informative, accurate, and neatly organized in JSON format. I need to make sure all the key points are covered without making it too overwhelming. Keeping it clear and structured will help the user extract the information they need easily.\\n\\nLastly, I should double-check all the facts to ensure accuracy. Population numbers can vary, so I\\'ll aim for a recent and reliable estimate. Also, ensuring that the JSON structure is valid is crucial to avoid any errors when the user processes it.\\n\\nAlright, putting it all together now. The JSON structure with categories will make the information easy to parse. Each category can represent different types of data, making it user-friendly. Including both historical and current information provides a comprehensive view.\\n\\nI think that covers everything the user asked for. Concise information in a structured format, along with key facts about the city, should meet their needs perfectly.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"paris\": {\\n    \"general_information\": {\\n      \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n      \"regional polygon\": \" Île-de-France\",\\n      \"headquarters\": \"City Hall of Paris\",\\n      \"officialoSéna\": \"Semblance of Paris\",\\n      \"incipient\": \"15 November 1355\",\\n      \"名称 change history\": [\\n        {\\n          \"period\": \"Historical\",\\n          \"description\": \"Official establishment as a commune in 15 November 1355.\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \"period\": \"Modern Era\",\\n          \"description\": \"Adoption of the French Republic on 22 December 1870, making Paris the capital of France.\"\\n        }\\n      ]\\n    },\\n    \"history\": {\\n      \"colonial history\": \"Paris has been a major European metropolis since the Middle Ages, evolving from a small town into one of the world\\'s most vibrant cities.

      "Generated text: Alright, I need to help the user get the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty straightforward. Now, I should figure out the most recent population numbers. I remember that the population of Paris is significantly larger than the rest of France combined. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should consider when the population was measured. I think the latest data I have is from 2021, which estimates the population to be around 2,157,000. That's a common figure I've seen in recent years, so I think it's safe to use that number unless there's a more recent source available. \n",
      "\n",
      "I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys. The main piece of information is the population, and maybe include the city name as a separate key for clarity. So, the JSON structure would have a \"capital\" key with the name \"Paris\" and a \"population\" key with the number.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes around the keys and string values, and proper commas between the key-value pairs. Also, I'll need to ensure that the JSON is valid so that it can be parsed correctly if used in a program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll write the JSON object with the two keys: \"capital\" and \"population\". For the population, I'll insert the number 2,157,000. I'll double-check the spelling of \"capital\" and \"population\" to make sure there are no typos. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner without any additional explanations since the user specifically asked for just the information in that format. That way, they can easily use or reference the JSON data as needed.\n",
