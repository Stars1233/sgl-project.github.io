    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",

    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

The user is in New York, so I'll set the city as 'New York' and the state as 'NY' since that's the two-letter abbreviation.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user just asked me for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, I should start by making sure I understand what they need. They want both the general information about the city and its population data, all wrapped up in a JSON structure. \\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out what exactly constitutes the \"general information.\" The capital is Paris, so I\\'ll definitely include that. I\\'ll list out what\\'s important—like city name, country, location, and maybe some key facts. Population is another big part, so I should find the latest data. I think the population of Paris is around 2 million. Wait, but I should be accurate. Maybe I should double-check the current estimates. \\n\\nPopulation figures can vary each year, so it\\'s probably best to get the most recent number, maybe from recent censuses or official sources. Let\\'s see... I believe the population is approximately 2,151,000 as of 2023. That seems about right. I should confirm that from a reliable source. \\n\\nThen, breaking down the population into components would be helpful. So, I\\'ll need to split it into residents, CCP members, and others. I\\'m not entirely sure about the current numbers, but roughly, I think the majority are non-CCP residents. Maybe around 93% are non-CCP, 5% CCP, and 2% other. That gives a good distribution for the JSON. \\n\\nI should also consider formatting the JSON correctly. Sometimes people make mistakes with commas and brackets, so I need to be careful there. Also, maybe I should include a source of information for credibility. I think the latest census was in 2022, so that would be a good reference. \\n\\nWait, is it worth adding the date of the most recent population data? That might be useful for the user to know the data\\'s validity. Probably, yes. \\n\\nAdditionally, maybe I can include some key landmarks or nickname to add a bit more detail to the general information. Paris is often called the \"City of Light\" or \"Le Van/var-oiseau.\" Including these can make the response more informative and interesting. \\n\\nI should also think about the structure of the JSON. It should be clear and user-friendly. Maybe a top-level key \"CityInformation\" with sub-keys for general info and population, each containing their respective details. That way, it\\'s organized and easy to parse. \\n\\nLet me organize the data. Starting with the general info: city name, country, location, and some key facts. Then, under population, include the current population, demographic breakdown, and the source. \\n\\nWait, should I include the date of population estimation? I think including it adds transparency. People might appreciate knowing when the data was last updated or estimated. \\n\\nIs there anything else I should add? Maybe something about Paris\\'s significance or history, but that might be beyond what the user asked for. Since the question was specific, sticking to the facts is best. \\n\\nI should also ensure that the JSON syntax is correct—no trailing commas, proper use of quotes, and correct formatting. It\\'s easy to make a mistake there, so attention to detail is crucial. \\n\\nLet me double-check the population numbers to make sure they\\'re up to date. Maybe the latest data from 2023 or 2022. I think the population of Paris is around 2.15 million, with a bit over a million residents excluding CCP members. So, my breakdown should reflect that accurately. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should clearly present both the general information and the population stats. I\\'ll structure each section with appropriate sub-keys and ensure the formatting is correct. \\n\\nAlright, I think I\\'ve got all the necessary data and should be ready to present it in the JSON format that the user requested.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"CityInformation\": {\\n    \"CityName\":

First, I know that Paris is the capital of France, that's a fact I've heard before. Now, for the population, I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's a big city, so maybe around 2 million? Wait, no, I've heard it's more than that. I think it's over 3 million now. But I'm not certain. Let me think, I remember reading that Paris has grown a lot over the years. Maybe around 3.5 million? Or is it 2.5 million? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. I think I should look up the most recent data, but since I can't access the internet right now, I'll have to rely on my memory. I believe the population is in the mid-3 million range. Let me go with 3.5 million for now. So, the JSON format should include the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the value 3500000. I should format it properly, using commas and brackets. Let me make sure the syntax is correct, with the keys in quotes and the values in double quotes. Yeah, that should do it.\n",
