    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

So I'll need to call both.<br><br>For the date and time, I should use 'get_current_date' and specify the timezone as 'America/New_York'. That will give me the exact current date and time in that location.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I'll use 'get_current_weather'. I should include the city as 'New York', the state as 'NY', and maybe set the unit to 'fahrenheit' since the user didn't specify. Alternatively, if they prefer Celsius, I can mention that option too, but since the example response used Fahrenheit, I'll stick with that.<br><br>I need to structure the response correctly. The user wants the date and weather information, so I'll present them clearly. I'll mention that the date and weather are based on an API call and provide a source tag for reference.<br><br>Wait, should I include the parameters in the function calls? Yes, each function call should have its parameters specified in the correct JSON format. So for 'get_current_date', the parameter is timezone with 'America/New_York'.

I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see... Yes, according to the latest data, the population is approximately 2,174,300 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \"country\". The city is Paris, the population is the number I found, and the country is France.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. The entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. I\\'ll format it properly to avoid any syntax errors.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have the city, population, and country. I\\'ll present this to the user, making sure it\\'s clear and easy to understand. I don\\'t think the user needs anything more detailed, so this should suffice.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need additional information, like the area or age distribution, but since they only asked for population, I\\'ll stick to that. Maybe they\\'ll ask for more details later, but for now, this response should be helpful.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '95bd989537a54a8887af86be6a6aa532', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 384, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.6325173377990723}}</strong>"

Hmm, I know the capital of France is Paris, so that\\'s a start. I need to make sure I get all the correct data without making any mistakes.\\n\\nFirst, I should outline the essential information about Paris. It\\'s the capital, so that\\'s number one. Then, its economic status—Paris is often called the \"City of Light\" and the \"Economic Capital of France.\" That\\'s good. As a cultural hub, it\\'s home to institutions like the Louvre and Shakespeare\\'s birthplace, so I should include that.\\n\\nNow, the user specifically wants population data. I need to be precise here. I remember reading that the population of Paris is around 2 million, but I should confirm the exact figure. Maybe it\\'s approximately 2,170,000 people as of 2021. That sounds about right. I\\'ll add that to the JSON as the population and mention that the figure is recent and subject to change.\\n\\nNext, Paris is a global city, bustling with activity in fashion, art, and culture. Including these elements will give a comprehensive view of its status. Also, being the political center, it houses government offices and facilitates international meetings, so that\\'s important to mention.\\n\\nI should structure the JSON properly. It should have a \"name\" key with \"Paris,\" a \"country\" key with \"France,\" and a \"description\" that covers all the aspects I thought of. Inside the \"population\" field, I\\'ll include the number and a note about the current year. \\n\\nWait, I should also ensure that the JSON syntax is correct. I\\'ll use quotes appropriately and separate keys with commas. No trailing commas are allowed, so I need to make sure each key ends correctly. \\n\\nI wonder if the user might need this information for a school project, a travel guide, or perhaps a statistics report. Providing accurate and up-to-date information is crucial so I\\'ll stick with recent stats. Also, offering the population as an approximate number makes sense since exact numbers can vary.\\n\\nLet me think about any potential issues. If the population figure isn\\'t accessible, I can\\'t provide the exact number, but since I have a source from 2021, it\\'s likely up to date as of 2023 when compiling this information. \\n\\nAnother consideration: maybe the user wants more details, but since they asked for a JSON, I should stick to the structure they requested. Any additional info would need to fit neatly into the JSON format without cluttering it.\\n\\nAlright, I think I\\'ve covered all the necessary points. Time to put it all together in the JSON format, ensuring accuracy and clarity.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"description\": \"The capital of France, Paris is a major city known for its rich history, architecture, and cultural significance. It serves as the economic, political, and cultural center of the country.\",\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"number\": 2170000,\\n    \"note\": \"The population figure is approximate as of recent estimates.\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '08f9d5a6267140f4be5c720f18233edd', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 680, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.368093967437744}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user asked me to provide the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I need to figure out what exactly they're looking for. The capital of France is Paris, so that's the key point. Now, I should gather the population data. I remember that the population can change over time, so I should check the most recent estimate. I think as of 2023, the population is around 3.5 million. But I should verify if that's accurate. Also, maybe I should include some key facts about Paris to give a comprehensive answer. Let me think about what other relevant information could be useful, like the area of the city, its significance, the neighbouring departments, and its official languages. Including these details will make the JSON more informative. I should structure the JSON with a \"Name\" field for the capital, a \"Population\" field with the number and some key stats, and a \"Key_Facts\" array that covers the area, significance, neighboring regions, and languages. I need to ensure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets in the right places. Let me double-check the population number to make sure it's up-to-date. I think it's roughly 3.5 million, but maybe it's a bit higher now. I'll go with 3,520,000 as of the latest data. Also, including the approximate density can add more context. So, putting it all together, I'll create the JSON with these elements. I hope this meets the user's needs and provides a clear, concise response.\n",
