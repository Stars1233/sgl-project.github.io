    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '8ddb493e5c7d4586aebcaf666ab4b31f', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.469204425811768}}</strong>"

First, I need to figure out what exactly they\\'re looking for. They want the population, which means I should check the current stats for Paris. But since the current population can fluctuate, maybe it\\'s better to provide a recent estimate or perhaps note that the data is approximate.\\n\\nI should start by identifying the capital of France. From what I know, Paris is definitively the capital. Now, gathering the population data is crucial. I need to find a reliable source for the latest figure. Maybe checking recent sources like official statistics from the IN see or maybe the World Bank data. I\\'ll have to make sure that the number I provide is accurate as of the current year.\\n\\nAlso, what kind of information do they want? They mentioned \"information,\" so I should consider including more than just the population. Maybe some key facts about the city, such as its historical significance, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower or Notre-Dame, and perhaps some cultural aspects like being the music capital of the world. Including that could make the response more comprehensive.\\n\\nNow, structuring the JSON. It should have a keys like \"City\" and \"Population\" with numerical values, and another object for additional information with relevant details. I should format it correctly to ensure it\\'s valid JSON.\\n\\nWait, the user also said \"capital of France.\" Is that necessarily the administrative center or the political center? Well, Paris is both, so that\\'s fine. But I should double-check if there are other capitals, but no, Paris is the only one.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that the population figure is current. Maybe it\\'s around 3.5 million as of 2023, but I should confirm that. Let me search my memory or any notes I might have. Yes, Paris does have a population around 3.5 million, but it\\'s growing slowly.\\n\\nOh, and the user asked for JSON, so I can\\'t have any markdown or anything; just plain JSON. I should make sure the syntax is correct—proper commas, quotation marks, brackets, etc. Maybe I should write it out carefully to avoid any syntax errors.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I think the JSON should look something like this: a top-level object with a \"City\" key pointing to \"Paris\" and a \"Population\" key with { \"current\": \"3,593,140\", \"notes\": \"approximate\" }. Then a details object inside a \"Information\" key, including historical facts, landmarks, etc.\\n\\nI should also add a script in case the user wants to test operations on the JSON. Maybe suggest a parse example so they can see the data in action, even though it\\'s just a console.log statement.\\n\\nWait, should I mention that the population figure is an estimate? Yes, because exact numbers can change yearly. So including that in the notes will be helpful.\\n\\nLet me just recap: capital is Paris, population is approximately 3.5 million, and provide some key facts. That should fulfill the user\\'s request comprehensively yet concisely in JSON format.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"City\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Population\": {\\n    \"current\": \"3593140\",\\n    \"notes\": \"approximate population figure as of recent data\"\\n  },\\n  \"Information\": {\\n    \"capital\": \"The City ofolum is the seat of government and politics in France.\",\\n    \"history\": \"Paris is one of the oldest cities in France and has a rich history dating back over 5,000 years.\",\\n    \"landmarks\": [\\n      \"Eiffel Tower\",\\n      \"Notre-Dame Cathedral\",\\n      \"centre Pompidou\",\\n      \"Leȃvre Museum\"\\n    ],\\n    \"cultural_significance\": \"Paris is renowned for its cultural and artistic heritage, being the birthplace of French Impressionism and home to many iconic landmarks.\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON format includes the city name, approximate population figure, and additional information about the capital of France.', 'meta_info': {'id': '22d0eb1ec6174d4785b0bc68292904f1', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 861, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 8.96309518814087}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Alright, I just received a query asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Okay, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out which city is the capital of France. I'm pretty sure it's Paris, but just to be thorough, I should double-check that. Yes, Paris is definitely the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to find out the population of Paris. I remember that major cities can have varying populations, so I should look up the most recent data. From what I know, Paris is a large city, so the population must be in the hundreds of millions. I think it's around 21 million people. But wait, that sounds a bit high. Let me verify. Oh, no, I think I mixed it up with another city. Actually, Paris has a population of about 2.1 million as of 2023. That makes more sense because other big cities like Tokyo or Delhi have populations over 30 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll need a \"capital\" key with the city name and a \"population\" key with the number. I should make sure the data is accurate, so I'll cross-reference a reliable source like a recent census or a trusted statistical database to confirm the population.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also thinking about the user's possible intent. They might be doing a project or a presentation and need this data quickly. Providing it in JSON is efficient because it's easy to parse and use in other applications if needed. Plus, JSON is widely supported, so the user won't have trouble integrating this data elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the user wants the population figure in a specific format, like a string with commas for readability. So I'll format it as \"2,100,000\" to make it clear. Also, I should ensure that the keys are in lowercase with underscores, as that's the standard for JSON keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look clean and straightforward. I'll avoid any extra fields unless the user specifies needing more information. Since they only asked for the capital and population, keeping it simple is best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll present the JSON and maybe offer further assistance if they need anything else. That way, I cover all bases and show that I'm ready to help beyond just this query.\n",
