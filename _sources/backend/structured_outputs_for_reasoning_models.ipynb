    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

I'll structure the function call as `<function=get_current_date '{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}'`.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I'll use `get_current_weather`. I need the city, state, and the unit. The city is New York, the state is NY, and since the user didn't specify, I'll default to Celsius.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '6f073a245b7d479394e24a9d44d78f48', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.578435182571411}}</strong>"

Hmm, okay, first things first, I need to figure out what exactly they\\'re looking for. The capital of France is definitely Paris, right? So I should start by confirming that. \\n\\nNow, the user wants the information in JSON. I know JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. They want it formatted properly, so I should make sure the key-value pairs are accurate and easy to read. Let me recall the population of Paris. I think it\\'s a large city, maybe around 2 million? I should double-check that. I\\'ll go with approximately 2.17 million since that\\'s the number I remember seeing in recent statistics.\\n\\nWait, should I include more details? The user specifically asked for information, so maybe I should cover area, population density, and whether it\\'s a global metropolis. That makes sense because it adds more context. \\n\\nAlso, I should ensure the JSON syntax is correct. Every key should be in quotes, and the values as well. The structure should have \"capital\" as the main key, and then inside it, \"name\" and \"data\" with their respective fields. I need to make sure there are commas in the right places and no trailing commas to avoid syntax errors.\\n\\nThinking about the user\\'s intent, they might be using this data for a project, maybe a school assignment or a presentation. Providing accurate and concise information in a clear format like JSON would be helpful for their needs. They might also appreciate if the numbers are up to date, so I wonder if the population figure is recent. Maybe I should add a note that the population data is approximate as it can change over time.\\n\\nHmm, I should also consider if the user is looking for more detailed information. Do they need data on demographics, infrastructure, or maybe economic aspects? But the query is pretty straightforward, so I\\'ll stick to population and other basic details. \\n\\nAlright, putting it all together, I\\'ll construct the JSON with the key-value pairs, ensuring it\\'s properly formatted. I\\'ll include the population numbers and add a note about them being approximate. That should cover what the user needs and present the information neatly.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2163000,\\n    \"area\": 105.5,\\n    \"population_density\": 20479.24,\\n    \"is_global ppt\": true\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNote: Population numbers may vary slightly depending on the source and year.

I'm not sure of the exact number, but I can say that it's approximately 3.5 to 4 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but sometimes the population can vary based on the source. Some might include just the urban area, while others include the broader metropolitan area. I think the metropolitan area population is higher, maybe around 12 million. However, the question specifically asks for the population of the capital, so I should focus on Paris itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting this together, I can estimate that the population of Paris is around 3.5 to 4 million people. I'm not entirely certain about the exact figure, but this range seems reasonable based on what I remember. I should probably mention that the number might vary slightly depending on the source or the time of the year, as populations can change due to various factors like births, deaths, and migrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, I'm going to state that the capital of France, Paris, has a population of approximately 3.5 to 4 million people, acknowledging that it's an estimate and could fluctuate.\n",

      "The estimated population of the capital city, Paris, is approximately 3.5 to 4 million people. This figure can vary slightly depending on the source or the time of the year, as populations are influenced by factors such as births, deaths, and migrations. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**\n",
      "The population of Paris, the capital of France, is approximately 3.5 to 4 million people.\n"
