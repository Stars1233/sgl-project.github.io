    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, they mentioned two separate things: the date and time, and the weather. I should figure out which functions to use for each.<br><br>Looking at the available functions, there's 'get_current_date' which requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I can use the timezone 'America/New_York' for that function. That should give me the current date and time in their local time zone.<br><br>Next, for the weather, the function 'get_current_weather' requires a city, state, and unit. The user is in New York, so the city is 'New York'. The state abbreviation for New York is 'NY'. They also specified Fahrenheit, so the unit should be 'fahrenheit'. <br><br>I need to make sure I structure each function call correctly. For the date, it's straightforward: call get_current_date with the timezone parameter set to 'America/New_York'. For the weather, I'll include all three parameters: city, state, and unit. <br><br>I should also ensure that each function call is on its own line, as per the instructions, and that I don't mix them together. That way, the user can easily read and understand each part of the response. <br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write two separate function calls. The first one will fetch the date and time, and the second one will fetch the weather details. I'll make sure to include the parameters in the correct format for each function.<br><br>I don't see any conflicting information or missing parameters. The functions are straightforward, so I shouldn't have any issues there. I'll double-check that all required parameters are included in each function call to avoid any errors.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the responses clearly, each on its own line, so the user can execute them one after the other without confusion.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '8b813ddc9a3d4695b7a9742b17aea8ad', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.64077091217041}}</strong>"

They\\'ve asked for the information and population of the capital of France, specifically in JSON format. First, I should recall that the capital is indeed Paris. Now, regarding the population, I need to make sure I provide the most current and accurate data. However, I remember that population figures can vary based on sources and the exact time of the year—like if it\\'s the current year or maybe a recent estimate.\\n\\nBreaking it down, the population of Paris is a well-known figure, but it\\'s always good to check the latest data. From what I know, as of 2023, the population is approximately 2,133,000, but I should verify that this is up-to-date. Alternatively, sometimes the population is rounded for simplicity, so it might be listed as around 2.1 million. Also, it\\'s possible that the number was slightly different when the user asked the question, so it\\'s better to present it accurately and let them know that the information is up to date.\\n\\nThe user has specified JSON format, so I need to structure the information accordingly. I\\'ll include the basic details: country, capital name, population, and the year of the estimate. To make it clear that all the information is accurate, I\\'ll add a \"source\" field, maybe indicating it\\'s the latest estimate from the French National Institute of Statistics and Demography (INSEE). \\n\\nI should also present the population in a clear numerical format, perhaps both as a number and a formatted number with commas for readability. This way, the user can easily parse the JSON and see the data clearly. Keeping the response straightforward and concise is key, especially since the user asked for information on the capital and its population.\\n\\nAnother consideration is the possibility of the user needing more detailed data, like historical population trends or additional statistics about Paris. However, since they specifically asked for the current information, I\\'ll stick to the basics. \\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll structure the JSON with proper syntax, using keys that are descriptive but concise: \"country,\" \"capital,\" \"population,\" and \"year.\" This makes the data easy to understand and use for any future processing or analysis the user might do with this information.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2133000,\\n  \"year\": \"2023\"\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '1fee1cb32ea642b888f16a9bf2cbf2e6', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 511, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.723321914672852}}</strong>"
