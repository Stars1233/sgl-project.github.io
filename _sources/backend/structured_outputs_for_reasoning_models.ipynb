    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'e10296993c1e42a896382a3ae941c58e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.756974697113037}}</strong>"

Maybe they\\'re working on a project or a task where having structured data is useful. They could be a student, a developer, or someone compiling information for a report.\\n\\nLooking deeper, perhaps they need this data for integration into another system that expects JSON.

I should double-check the population figure to ensure it\\'s accurate. \\n\\nWait, the population figure I provided earlier was 94.9 million in 2023. Is that the most recent data? I should make sure that\\'s up to date. If it\\'s not, that might not be helpful.\\n\\nAlso, the user didn\\'t specify the exact year, so I should mention that the population is changing. Maybe including the range of estimates or the latest available data would be better. \\n\\nI should check if there\\'s more relevant information that could be included in the JSON. Maybe the area of Paris, some key landmarks, or notable features? But the user only requested population, so I\\'ll stick to that.\\n\\nOh, and I should present the JSON clearly, maybe adding comments if needed, but probably not necessary. Keeping it simple as per the user\\'s initial request.\\n\\nI should also make sure that the JSON syntax is correct—proper commas, quotation marks, and indentation for readability. That way, the user gets the information neatly organized without any syntax errors.\\n\\nIn summary, I need to provide the population correctly, format it in JSON, mention any relevant notes about the data, and ensure everything is presented clearly and accurately.

First, I need to identify what exactly they're looking for. They mentioned the capital, which is straightforward—Paris. But they also want the population, so I should make sure to include that data.\n",

      "Wait, the user didn't specify whether they want the population as a number or maybe just a general statement. I'll go with the actual number for accuracy. But I should also mention that the population is approximate because it can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about including some interesting facts to make the response more engaging. Maybe something about Paris's history or its significance. That way, the user gets more than just the numbers, which could add value.\n",

      "I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct. Typically, you have an \"info\" key with various sub-keys. So under \"info\", I'll include \"country\", \"city\", \"population\", and \"fact\". Each of these will have their respective values. \n",
      "\n",
      "Double-checking the population number is important because it's a sensitive and constantly changing figure. I'll look up the latest estimate to ensure accuracy. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Paris has a population around 2.2 million. \n",
