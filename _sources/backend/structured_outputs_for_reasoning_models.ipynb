    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Okay, checking a reliable source, and it says the population is approximately 3,600,000. That seems right.<br><br>Now, the user wants this in JSON format. I need to structure it properly. The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '624d7aab561847b1a6bb1f86794b9dd3', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.583492755889893}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I need to figure out the capital of France and provide its population in JSON format. Let\\'s start by recalling what I know about France. I know that Paris is the capital city in France, right? It\\'s the most important city there, a major transportation hub, and it\\'s also a well-known tourist spot. \\n\\nNow, regarding the population, I\\'m not exactly sure about the exact number, but I remember it\\'s a big city. I think it\\'s over 30 million people. I\\'ve heard some approximations before, like around 32 or 33 million. Maybe I should check some sources or think about other cities I know to get a sense. \\n\\nFor example, I know that London has about 9 million people, Tokyo has around 30 million, and New York has about 8.5 million. Given that Paris is a major city, its population should be larger than that. I\\'ve heard that it\\'s one of the largest cities in Europe, so it\\'s plausible that it\\'s around 33 million. \\n\\nWait, but I\\'m not entirely certain. I think the population of Paris might have been around that number a few years ago. Maybe it\\'s slightly different now, considering the growth over the years. Also, sometimes population figures are estimates, especially for such large cities. \\n\\nI should probably state that the population is approximately 33 million, acknowledging that it\\'s a rough estimate. It\\'s important to be clear about that to avoid misinformation. So, in the JSON format, I\\'ll need to structure it properly. \\n\\nLet me outline what I need: a JSON object with a key for the capital city and another for its population. The population should be a numerical value with a note explaining that it\\'s an approximate figure. \\n\\nSo, combining all of this, I can construct the JSON as follows:\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": \"33000000\",\\n  \"note\": \"Population estimate as of 2023\"\\n}\\n\\nThat seems to cover all the necessary points. I just need to make sure that the information is accurate and clearly presented. I should also ensure that the JSON syntax is correct, with proper quotation marks and commas to avoid any errors when the data is used.\\n\\nWait, is the population figure in the JSON correct? I think I should double-check. I believe the actual population in 2021 was around 31.5 million, but sometimes estimates can be a bit off. Maybe it\\'s better to go with 33 million as it\\'s still close and often cited as an approximate figure. \\n\\nAlso, considering language, sometimes people might confuse Paris with the Île-de-France region, which includes other cities, but the capital itself is Paris. So, I should stick to Paris as the capital without including the region.\\n\\nIn summary, my JSON should clearly state the capital as Paris, its population as approximately 33 million, and a note that the figure is an estimate. That way, anyone using this data knows that it\\'s approximate and not an exact count.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 33000000,\\n  \"note\": \"Population estimate as of 2021\"\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '1dcf7eb1b2114b0a93112cde889c7599', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 683, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.440582036972046}}</strong>"

      "First, I need to determine the capital of France. That's straightforward—I know it's Paris. But wait, I should double-check just to be sure. Yes, Paris is definitively the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the population. I'm pretty sure the latest data puts it around 2 million. But I should verify the exact number. Maybe it's slightly different this year due to recent changes. Let me recall... I think it's approximately 2,140,526. Hmm, I remember reading that it's about 2.14 million as of 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, formatting this in JSON. The user wants the information and population, so I'll structure it with the country name, capital, and population. The keys should be clear, like \"country,\" \"capital,\" and \"population.\" The population number should be a number type, not a string, so it's better to leave it as is without quotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"country\": \"France\",\n",
      "  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 2140526\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the syntax is correct—commas in the right places, colons after keys, and proper closing braces. Also, keeping the formatting clean and readable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if the user needs this for a specific application or just as a fact-check. Since they're asking for information and population, they might be using it for a project or report. Maybe they need it programmatically, so accuracy is key. I should ensure the data is up-to-date and correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe add a note about the population being approximate or citing the source, but the user didn't ask for that. They just want the JSON, so I'll stick to that.\n",
