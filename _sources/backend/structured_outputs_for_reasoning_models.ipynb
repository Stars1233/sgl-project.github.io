    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to generate information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format. Hmm, where do I start? Well, I know that Paris is the main city in France, but I'm not exactly sure about all the details. Let me think about what information is typically included about a city's capital.<br><br>First, the name of the city is obviously Paris. Then, the country it's the capital of, which is France. I remember that Paris is the largest city in France, but I'm not sure about its population. I think it's a big city, maybe around 2 million people? I'm not certain, though. I should probably look that up, but since I'm just brainstorming, I'll go with that for now.<br><br>Next, the location. Paris is located in the northern part of France, specifically in the Île-de-France region. I think it's on the Seine River, which is a major river there. The Eiffel Tower is in Paris, so that's a key landmark. I should include that.<br><br>Language-wise, Paris is a center for French culture, so French is definitely the predominant language. I'm not sure about minority languages or dialects, but maybe there are some, but I don't know which ones. I'll just note that French is the main language.<br><br>Cuisine is another aspect. Paris is famous for its food, like baguettes, croissants, and wine. I should mention some of the popular dishes, maybe something like \"Baguette,Croissant, and wine.\"<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has a well-developed public transit system, like the Métro, which is a subway network. I think there are trams and buses too. I should include that the public transport is extensive.<br><br>Economically, Paris is a significant hub. I believe it's home to many multinational companies and financial institutions. Maybe something like \"home to many multinational companies and financial institutions.\"<br><br>Culturally, Paris is rich in museums, art, and historical sites. The Louvre and the Musée d'Histéritage come to mind. Also, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so I should mention that.<br><br>I should also include some notable landmarks. The Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, Notre-Dame, and the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. Maybe the gardens around the Eiffel Tower, like Champ de Mars.<br><br>Now, putting this all together into JSON format. I need to structure it with the key \"capital\" and then include all these details as a value. I'll organize them under different categories for clarity, like \"name,\" \"country,\" \"population,\" \"location,\" \"language,\" \"cuisine,\" \"transportation,\" \"economy,\" \"culture,\" and \"landmarks.\"<br><br>Wait, I'm not sure about the population figure. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should double-check that, but for now, I'll proceed with that number.<br><br>Also, I'm not sure if Paris is the only city in France that's a capital. I think there are others, but Paris is the main one. So, I should specify that Paris is the main capital.<br><br>I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks. Each key should be in quotes, and the entire structure should be an object within the \"capital\" key.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each category as a key, and the corresponding details as values. I'll make sure to include all the points I thought of, but I'll keep it concise and relevant.<br><br>I think that's a good start. Now, I'll format it properly in JSON, ensuring that each key is correctly spelled and the values are accurate based on my understanding.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the information about the capital of France and present it in JSON format. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about France. I know that Paris is the capital, but I should double-check that to be sure. Yeah, Paris is definitely the administrative and cultural center of France.<br><br>Now, I need to gather more details about Paris. Let me think about its location. Paris is located in the northern part of France, right? It's in the Île-de-France region. I remember that it's an island, so that's an important geographical feature. The coordinates are something like 48°51′N 2°28′E. I think that's correct, but I should make sure. Maybe I can visualize it on a map—Paris is in the north, near the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River.<br><br>Next, I should consider the history of Paris. It's been a major city for centuries. I know that during the French Revolution, Paris was the center of the revolution, and it's still a significant cultural and political hub today. It's also a global city, attracting millions of visitors each year.<br><br>Economically, Paris is a major financial and business center. I believe it's home to many multinational corporations and financial institutions. The Paris Stock Exchange comes to mind, and there are a lot of big companies based there. The city is also known for its fashion industry, with some of the world's most famous brands having headquarters in Paris.<br><br>Culturally, Paris is rich with art, literature, and history. The Louvre Museum is one of the world's largest art museums, and it's located in Paris. There's also the Musée d'Orsay, which is another major cultural institution. The city has a vibrant nightlife, with famous bars and clubs. I think places like Le Marais and Montmartre are known for their lively nightlife and artistic scenes.<br><br>Demographically, Paris is a large city, but it's also one of the most densely populated in the world. The metropolitan area covers a vast area, extending beyond the city limits into the outer suburbs. The population is diverse, with people from many different countries and backgrounds living there.<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has an extensive public transit system, including the Métro, which is a highly efficient subway network. There are also buses, trams, and trolleys that serve the city. The Seine River has several bridges and ferries that connect different parts of the city.<br><br>I should also mention some notable landmarks. The Eiffel Tower is a must-see, and the Arc de Triomphe is another iconic structure. The Notre-Dame Cathedral is a major religious site, though it's had some recent renovations and changes due to the fire that occurred in 2019.<br><br>In terms of language, Paris is a city where French is the official language, but it's also a multicultural city. People from around the world speak English, Spanish, German, and other languages there, contributing to a very international atmosphere.<br><br>I think I've covered the main points. Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. I'll start with the basic information: name, location, and status. Then, I'll add historical, economic, cultural, demographic, transportation, and notable landmarks sections. Each section will have relevant details under subkeys.<br><br>Wait, I should make sure that the JSON syntax is correct. I'll use proper braces, commas, and quotation marks. Also, I'll ensure that the keys are in lowercase letters as per JSON standards. Let me organize the information step by step.<br><br>First, the capital object will have properties like name, location, and status. Then, each additional section will be an object with its own properties.

The Louvre Museum is another famous spot. The Arc de Triomphe is also iconic. Maybe the Seine River is important too since it\\'s a major river in the city.\\n\\nI should structure this in JSON. So, the main object would have a \"country\" key pointing to \"France,\" and the \"capital\" key pointing to \"Paris.\" Under \"capital,\" I can have an \"info\" array that includes population, landmarks, and maybe some other info like the date it became the capital or the official name. Wait, I think Paris has been the capital since the 10th century, but I\\'m not certain about the exact year. I\\'ll just put around 978 AD for now.\\n\\nLet me make sure I\\'m not missing anything important. Maybe the official name of the city is \"City of Light,\" which is the official name of Paris. Including that could be helpful. Also, perhaps the area of the city, but I don\\'t remember the exact figure. Maybe around 105 square kilometers? I\\'m not sure, but I\\'ll include it as an estimate.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure would have a top-level object with \"country\" and \"capital.\" The \"capital\" would have an \"info\" array with population, landmarks, area, and official name.

I should double-check some of these numbers to make sure they\\'re accurate, but since I\\'m just recalling, I\\'ll proceed with what I have.\\n\\nWait, I should also consider if there are any other notable facts. Maybe the number of hospitals or universities? I\\'m not sure, but perhaps that\\'s too detailed.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to create a JSON representation of the information about the capital of France, which is Paris. Let me start by listing all the details I remember about Paris.\\n\\nFirst, Paris is the capital city of France. Its population is quite large, I think around 2.2 million people. The area it covers is extensive, maybe over 100 square kilometers. Paris is known for many landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Sacré-Cœur Basilica, and the Louvre Museum. It\\'s also a major economic hub with a GDP ranking somewhere in the top 10 globally.\\n\\nI remember that Paris is a global city with a rich cultural history, a significant cultural heritage, and is a major political center. It has a rich artistic scene, notable for artists like Vincent van Gogh andbenefitted from figures like Ada Lovelace, who was an early computer programmer. Paris is also a design mecca, famous for luxury fashion and high-end shopping.\\n\\nIn terms of language, Paris is a city where French is the primary language, but many people speak English, especially in tourist areas. The climate is temperate, with mild winters and hot, sunny summers. Public transportation is well-developed with a metro, buses, and trams. There are also well-connected subways.\\n\\nI should structure this information into a JSON format. Starting with a top-level key like \"capital_information\". Within that, I can have nested objects for population, climate, etc. Each country has its own set of details, so I\\'ll create a \"country\" key with more information about France\\'s history, economy, geography, government, etc.\\n\\nI need to make sure all the data is accurate. For example, confirming Paris\\'s population, landmarks, and any other specific facts. I might need to check if the GDP figure is up to date and accurate. Also, the list of notable artists and their contributions would add to the cultural aspect.\\n\\nI\\'ll organize the JSON with an overview, population, notable landmarks, economic status, cultural significance, climate, transportation, and language. This should cover all essential aspects of the capital.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll make sure the JSON syntax is correct, using proper commas and braces, and ensure there are no typos to maintain validity.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital_information\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"country\": {\\n      \"name\": \"France\",\\n      \"history\": [\\n        \" catastrophic events like the French Revolution (1789-1799), the Hundred Days (1815), and the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871).\",\\n        \"Revolutionary government established during the French Revolution.\",\\n        \"Aftervision of 1789.\",\\n        \"Expansionist policies leading to World War I.\",\\n        \"A short-lived flowering in the early 20th century under共享单车 and the Treaty of Versailles.\",\\n        \" restoring monarchy under Napoleon III in 1881.\",\\n        \" French Fifth Republic began in 1948.\",\\n        \"Post-war society facing challenges of learnings, social transformation, and rebuilding\"\\n      ]\\n    },\\n    \"population\": {\\n      \"current_population\": 217,270,\\n      \"rho\": \"The population figure may vary slightly depending on the source and the year of measurement.\",\\n      \"year\": 2021\\n    },\\n    \"area\": {\\n      \"total_area\": 109.39 HTML公顷,\\n      \"dense_area\": 8.56 HTML公顷,\\n      \"under_water_area\": \"N/A\"\\n    },\\n    \"notable_landmarks\": [\\n      {\\n        \"name\": \"Eiffel Tower\",\\n        \"description\": \"A symbolic Landmark of Paris and a landmark of the world.\"\\n      },\\n      {\\n        \"name\": \"Sacré-Cœur Basilica\",\\n        \"description\": \"A masterpiece of French Gothic architecture that is Least visited and most visited.\"\\n      },\\n      {\\n        \"name\": \"Louvre Museum\",\\n        \"description\": \" contains over 38,000 objects from different cultures.\"\\n      }\\n    ],\\n    \"economy\": {\\n      \"gdp\": {\\n        \"value\": 2.787 trillion euro,\\n        \"rank\": \"Top 10 globally\"\\n      },\\n      \"main_industries\": [\\n        {\\n          \"name\": \" tourism\",\\n          \"description\": \"A significant contributor to the economy.\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \"name\": \" fashion\",\\n          \"description\": \"Particularly luxury fashion, which is a global leader.\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \"name\": \" technology and engineering\",\\n          \"description\": \"With many companies and startups based in the area.\"\\n        }\\n      ],\\n      \"government\": {\\n        \"type\": \" unitary semi-presidential republic\",\\n        \"years\": [\\n          \"Between the early 19th and late 20th century.\"\\n        ]\\n      }\\n    },\\n    \"culture\": {\\n      \"cuisine\": {\\n        \"famous_dishes\": [\\n          \"Bouillons\",\\n          \"Baguettes\",\\n          \"Mir visibly RolliBLT, Pain d\\'Chine, and Chinois et auujaun.\"\\n        ]\\n      },\\n      \"arts_and_recreations\": [\\n        \" visual arts and architecture\",\\n        \" music\",\\n        \" theater\",\\n        \" sports\"\\n      ],\\n      \"-footer_landmarks\": [\\n        \"Le Marais\",\\n        \"Le Quartier Latin\",\\n        \"Les Batignolles\"\\n      ]\\n    },\\n    \"climate\": {\\n      \"description\": \"Temperate climate with mild winters and hot, sunny summers.\",\\n      \"winters\": \" generally mild with short and cool winters.\",\\n      \"summers\": \" hot and sunny.\"\\n    },\\n    \"transportation\": {\\n      \"public_transport\": {\\n        \"items\": [\\n          \"Metro\",\\n          \"Buses\",\\n          \"Trams\"\\n        ]\\n      },\\n      \"subway\": {\\n        \"description\": \"Extensive network of rail lines connecting different parts of the city.\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n    \"language\": {\\n      \"major_langs\": [\\n        \"French\",\\n        \"English (exceptional)\"\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '46ac889e65d1479e93750f1e81767b84', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 1292, 'cached_tokens': 19, 'e2e_latency': 13.097178936004639}}</strong>"

      "Make sure to include all the required fields: for the city info, it's name, country, population, area, and the capital flag. For the array, each city should have name, population, and area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, so I need to figure out how to structure this JSON data. Let me start by recalling what the user is asking for. They want the information of the capital of France in JSON format, then convert that into a JSONP object. Also, they need a JSON array with 5 different cities in France, each having population and area. Finally, they want a JSON object that combines both the capital info and the array of cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital. So, the JSON for the capital should include its name, country, population, area, and whether it's the capital. Wait, the user mentioned the fields for the city info should be name, country, population, area, and capital flag. So, the JSON for the capital would look like:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"name\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"country\": \"France\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 1000000, // I'm not sure about the exact number, but for example's sake, let's say 1 million.\n",
      "  \"area\": 100000, // Again, approximate values.\n",
      "  \"capital\": true\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to convert this into a JSONP object. JSONP typically wraps the JSON in a function and adds a \"func\" key. So, it would look like:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"func\": function() {\n",
      "    return {\n",
      "      \"name\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "      \"country\": \"France\",\n",
      "      \"population\": 1000000,\n",
      "      \"area\": 100000,\n",
      "      \"capital\": true\n",
      "    };\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but JSONP often uses a function that returns the JSON object. So, the structure is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, moving on to the array of 5 cities in France. I need to list 5 cities, each with their population and area. I should pick well-known cities to make it accurate. Let me think of some major cities in France:\n",

      "Alright, so I need to figure out how to provide the information of the capital of France in JSON format, then convert that into a JSONP object. After that, I have to create a JSON array with five different cities in France, each including their population and area. Finally, I need to combine both the capital info and the array into a single JSON object.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me recall what the capital of France is. I think it's Paris. Yes, Paris is the capital city of France. Now, I need to find the population and area of Paris. I'm not exactly sure about the current numbers, but I remember that Paris has a large population and a significant area. Let me check my memory: I think the population is around 2 million and the area is about 105 square kilometers. I should verify these numbers to be accurate, but for the sake of this exercise, I'll go with these figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to represent this information in JSON format. The structure should include the name, country, population, and area. So, the JSON object for the capital would look like this:\n",

      "    \"area\": 105\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, moving on to the JSONP object. JSONP typically involves wrapping the JSON object in a function and providing a callback. The syntax is usually function() { return JSON; }. So, converting the above JSON into a JSONP object would involve adding a function wrapper. It would look something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "function() {\n",
      "  return {\n",

      "    }\n",
      "  };\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's the correct way to structure a JSONP object.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, onto the second part: creating a JSON array of five different cities in France, each with their population and area. I need to choose five cities. Let me think of some major cities in France. I know Paris, but I need four more. Maybe Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, and Nice? Or maybe I should include some other cities to make it diverse. Let me check their populations and areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Paris: As mentioned, population around 2 million, area about 105 km².\n",
      "2. Lyon: I believe Lyon has a population of around 400,000 and an area of about 100 km².\n",
      "3. Marseille: Population is around 1.5 million, area about 100 km².\n",
      "4. Toulouse: Population is around 300,000, area about 100 km².\n",
      "5. Nice: Population is around 600,000, area about 200 km².\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should verify these numbers because I might be off. For example, Nice's area is actually larger, maybe around 200 km², but the population is a bit lower. Let me adjust accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the JSON array would look like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "[\n",
      "  {\n",
      "    \"name\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "    \"population\": 2000000,\n",
