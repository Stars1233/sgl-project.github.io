    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to generate information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format. Hmm, where do I start? Well, I know that Paris is the main city in France, but I'm not exactly sure about all the details. Let me think about what information is typically included about a city's capital.<br><br>First, the name of the city is obviously Paris. Then, the country it's the capital of, which is France. I remember that Paris is the largest city in France, but I'm not sure about its population. I think it's a big city, maybe around 2 million people? I'm not certain, though. I should probably look that up, but since I'm just brainstorming, I'll go with that for now.<br><br>Next, the location. Paris is located in the northern part of France, specifically in the Île-de-France region. I think it's on the Seine River, which is a major river there. The Eiffel Tower is in Paris, so that's a key landmark. I should include that.<br><br>Language-wise, Paris is a center for French culture, so French is definitely the predominant language. I'm not sure about minority languages or dialects, but maybe there are some, but I don't know which ones. I'll just note that French is the main language.<br><br>Cuisine is another aspect. Paris is famous for its food, like baguettes, croissants, and wine. I should mention some of the popular dishes, maybe something like \"Baguette,Croissant, and wine.\"<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has a well-developed public transit system, like the Métro, which is a subway network. I think there are trams and buses too. I should include that the public transport is extensive.<br><br>Economically, Paris is a significant hub. I believe it's home to many multinational companies and financial institutions. Maybe something like \"home to many multinational companies and financial institutions.\"<br><br>Culturally, Paris is rich in museums, art, and historical sites. The Louvre and the Musée d'Histéritage come to mind. Also, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so I should mention that.<br><br>I should also include some notable landmarks. The Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, Notre-Dame, and the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. Maybe the gardens around the Eiffel Tower, like Champ de Mars.<br><br>Now, putting this all together into JSON format. I need to structure it with the key \"capital\" and then include all these details as a value. I'll organize them under different categories for clarity, like \"name,\" \"country,\" \"population,\" \"location,\" \"language,\" \"cuisine,\" \"transportation,\" \"economy,\" \"culture,\" and \"landmarks.\"<br><br>Wait, I'm not sure about the population figure. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should double-check that, but for now, I'll proceed with that number.<br><br>Also, I'm not sure if Paris is the only city in France that's a capital. I think there are others, but Paris is the main one. So, I should specify that Paris is the main capital.<br><br>I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks. Each key should be in quotes, and the entire structure should be an object within the \"capital\" key.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each category as a key, and the corresponding details as values. I'll make sure to include all the points I thought of, but I'll keep it concise and relevant.<br><br>I think that's a good start. Now, I'll format it properly in JSON, ensuring that each key is correctly spelled and the values are accurate based on my understanding.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the information about the capital of France and present it in JSON format. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about France. I know that Paris is the capital, but I should double-check that to be sure. Yeah, Paris is definitely the administrative and cultural center of France.<br><br>Now, I need to gather more details about Paris. Let me think about its location. Paris is located in the northern part of France, right? It's in the Île-de-France region. I remember that it's an island, so that's an important geographical feature. The coordinates are something like 48°51′N 2°28′E. I think that's correct, but I should make sure. Maybe I can visualize it on a map—Paris is in the north, near the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River.<br><br>Next, I should consider the history of Paris. It's been a major city for centuries. I know that during the French Revolution, Paris was the center of the revolution, and it's still a significant cultural and political hub today. It's also a global city, attracting millions of visitors each year.<br><br>Economically, Paris is a major financial and business center. I believe it's home to many multinational corporations and financial institutions. The Paris Stock Exchange comes to mind, and there are a lot of big companies based there. The city is also known for its fashion industry, with some of the world's most famous brands having headquarters in Paris.<br><br>Culturally, Paris is rich with art, literature, and history. The Louvre Museum is one of the world's largest art museums, and it's located in Paris. There's also the Musée d'Orsay, which is another major cultural institution. The city has a vibrant nightlife, with famous bars and clubs. I think places like Le Marais and Montmartre are known for their lively nightlife and artistic scenes.<br><br>Demographically, Paris is a large city, but it's also one of the most densely populated in the world. The metropolitan area covers a vast area, extending beyond the city limits into the outer suburbs. The population is diverse, with people from many different countries and backgrounds living there.<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has an extensive public transit system, including the Métro, which is a highly efficient subway network. There are also buses, trams, and trolleys that serve the city. The Seine River has several bridges and ferries that connect different parts of the city.<br><br>I should also mention some notable landmarks. The Eiffel Tower is a must-see, and the Arc de Triomphe is another iconic structure. The Notre-Dame Cathedral is a major religious site, though it's had some recent renovations and changes due to the fire that occurred in 2019.<br><br>In terms of language, Paris is a city where French is the official language, but it's also a multicultural city. People from around the world speak English, Spanish, German, and other languages there, contributing to a very international atmosphere.<br><br>I think I've covered the main points. Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. I'll start with the basic information: name, location, and status. Then, I'll add historical, economic, cultural, demographic, transportation, and notable landmarks sections. Each section will have relevant details under subkeys.<br><br>Wait, I should make sure that the JSON syntax is correct. I'll use proper braces, commas, and quotation marks. Also, I'll ensure that the keys are in lowercase letters as per JSON standards. Let me organize the information step by step.<br><br>First, the capital object will have properties like name, location, and status. Then, each additional section will be an object with its own properties.

The Louvre Museum is another famous spot. The Arc de Triomphe is also iconic. Maybe the Seine River is important too since it\\'s a major river in the city.\\n\\nI should structure this in JSON. So, the main object would have a \"country\" key pointing to \"France,\" and the \"capital\" key pointing to \"Paris.\" Under \"capital,\" I can have an \"info\" array that includes population, landmarks, and maybe some other info like the date it became the capital or the official name.

I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s a given. I should probably include its population data, maybe the approximate number, and the language spoken there. \\n\\nI\\'ve heard that Paris is the most populated city in France, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the population number. I think it\\'s around 3.5 million, but I should double-check that. Oh, and it\\'s in the northern part of the country, so its coordinates are probably in the 48th and 49th latitudes. I remember something about the Seine River running through it; that\\'s important for the city\\'s history.\\n\\nWait, where exactly is Paris located geographically? The Seine River is the default river there, but there are others like the Marne and the seine is the main one. Paris has a rich cultural history. When was it founded? I think it was ancient times, maybe established by the Gauls. It became a significant settlement under the romans. \\n\\nIn the Middle Ages, Paris was a major city, and they built a lot of cathedrals. The Latin Quarter is famous with all those universities and artists, right? And then there\\'s the Eiffel Tower. Modern Paris has seen changes, like tours and more tourists, but it\\'s still a major transportation hub with good public transit.\\n\\nPopulation-wise, cities can vary. The urban area is much bigger than the downtown area. I think the urbanized population is higher. Maybe the urbanized population is like 11.8 million? That makes sense because Paris is a major city in France.\\n\\nFor languages, French is the official language, but English is widely understood, especially in tourist areas. Also, some people speak German or other European languages depending on their origin.\\n\\nickers... maybe I should include让学生们了解巴黎的历史、地理位置和人口统计数据。 Paris 的位置大约是纬度 48.8566° N 和经度 2.3522° E。人口方面，城市人口可能在100万到200万之间，而 urbanized population 可能更高。我需要确认这些数字是否准确，特别是在最新的统计数据中。\\n\\n为了准确性，我可以回忆一下，巴黎的人口在过去几十年里有不同的估计。比如，1980年代大约是80万到100万，现在增加到大约110万到120万之间。因此， urbanized population 可能更接近这一数目。另外，语言方面，除了法语以外，英语在许多情况下也被使用，尤其是在非正式场合或者国际交流中。\\n\\n地理位置方面，除了大 River Seine 以外，法国北部的河流还包括 Seine 和 Marne. 对于历史来说，Paris 的起源可以追溯到古罗马时期，叫做 Consuls, 但后来罗马帝国的征服导致了人口的大量迁移和城市丝绸之路。中世纪时期，它成为了文化和经济中心，吸引了许多学者、艺术家和政治家。现代Paris是一个国际化大都市，拥有丰富的文化遗产和历史遗迹。\\n\\n总的来说，这个JSON 应该涵盖Paris的基本信息，让它看起来准确且有用。我需要确保所有数据都是最新的，并且格式正确，这样学习者可以用获取信息来查找更多的细节。现在，我需要把这些 thoughts 整合成一个结构清晰、易于理解的JSON格式。\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"history\": {\\n    \"ancient\": \"Founded by the Gauls in antiquity\",\\n    \"roman_period\": \"Established during the Roman Period\",\\n    \"medieval_century\": \"A major settlement during the Middle Ages\",\\n    \"cathedrals\": \"Known for numerous historic cathedrals\",\\n    \"universities\": \"Home to the famous Latin Quarter and universities\",\\n    \"Landmarks\": \"Landmarks include the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame Cathedral\"\\n  },\\n  \"geography\": {\\n    \"coordinates\": {\\n      \"latitude\": 48.8566° N,\\n      \"longitude\": 2.3522° E\\n    },\\n    \" scarf_river\": \"Bordered by the River Seine and others like the Marne\",\\n    \"topography\": \"Known for its rich natural heritage\"\\n  },\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"urban_area\": \"100,000 to 200,000\",\\n    \"urbanized_population\": \"12.5 million to 17 million\",\\n    \"marineProjection Jung\\'s\": \"Language usage includes French, English, and others\"\\n  },\\n  \"Culture\": {\\n    \"Primary-Language\": \"French\",\\n    \"other_languages\": [\"English\", \"German\"],\\n    \"cultural_heritage\": \"Rich in art, history, and culture\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n这个JSON结构清晰，包含了巴黎的历史、地理位置、人口数据以及文化方面的基本信息，对使用者来说易于理解和使用。', 'meta_info': {'id': '99da965a49414ef0a9197786b0344841', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 1053, 'cached_tokens': 19, 'e2e_latency': 10.316279649734497}}</strong>"

      "\n",
      "Alright, so I need to figure out how to structure this JSON data. Let me start by recalling what the user is asking for.

      "First, I should identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital. So, the JSON for the capital should include its name, country, population, area, and whether it's the capital.

      "  \"capital\": true\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to convert this into a JSONP object. JSONP typically wraps the JSON in a function and adds a \"func\" key. So, it would look like:\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, moving on to the array of 5 cities in France. I need to list 5 cities, each with their population and area. I should pick well-known cities to make it accurate. Let me think of some major cities in France:\n",

      "- Lyon: Population around 400,000, area about 100 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Marseille: Population around 600,000, area about 150 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Toulouse: Population around 300,000, area about 120 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Lille: Population around 450,000, area about 110 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Nîmes: Population around 250,000, area about 80 square kilometers.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the JSON array would be:\n",

The population is approximately 5 million, so I'll write that as 5000000. The area is about 9,400 square kilometers, so that's 9400. The official language is English, so that's straightforward.\n",

      "  \"official_language\": \"English\"\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that covers everything the user asked for. They wanted the JSON with key-value pairs, and I included the capital, population, area, and official language. I should double-check if there are any other details they might need, but based on the information given, this should be sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user also mentioned that the population is approximately 5 million, the area is about 9,400 square kilometers, and the official language is English. I included all of these in the JSON. I don't think I need to add anything else unless they specify more details, but they didn't ask for more information, so I think this is all that's needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure that the JSON syntax is correct. The keys are in double quotes, the string values are in double quotes, and the numbers are without quotes. The commas are in the right places, and the structure is properly formatted. I don't see any syntax errors here.\n",
