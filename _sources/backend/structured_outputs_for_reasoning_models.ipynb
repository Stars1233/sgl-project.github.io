    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Okay, checking a reliable source, and it says the population is approximately 3,600,000. That seems right.<br><br>Now, the user wants this in JSON format. I need to structure it properly. The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '1277fd3b47c74a94bd8dda882adfc751', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.79030179977417}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I just came across this query where someone is asking for the information and population of France\\'s capital in JSON format. Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step. \\n\\nFirst, I should figure out what exactly the user is asking for. The capital of France is definitely Paris, right? So, the population part will have to include the current number. I remember that populations can change over time, so I need to make sure I have the most recent data. Let me recall, I think the population figure I have is around 3.5 million. But wait, is that accurate? I should double-check that to be sure.\\n\\nNow, for the JSON format part. The user wants it structured, so I should make sure the information is organized properly. Maybe something like a key-value pair where \"capital\" is \"Paris\" and \"population\" is the number. I should also consider including some related geographical details, like the location within France and some notable landmarks, to give a comprehensive answer.\\n\\nI wonder who the user is. They might be a student working on a project, or maybe someone planning a trip. Including the population in the context of the country\\'s administrative divisions could help them understand the scale better. Also, sites like Wikipedia or recent demographic reports should back up the population figure to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nAnother thought: ages matter. This information could be from a few years ago, so it\\'s important to mention that the figure might vary slightly. Users should always check the most updated sources for current data, especially since population stats can change due to births, deaths, and migrations.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure should be clean and easy to parse. Including related keys like country and regions will provide extra context. Let me make sure all the data is correctly formatted. Oh, and the explanation should be clear, so the user understands how to use the provided information.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve covered all the bases. Just need to present it in a way that\\'s both accurate and helpful. Hopefully, this will meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>\\n\\nCertainly! Here is the information in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"as_of\": \"2023\",\\n    \"estimated\": 3500000,\\n    \"description\": \"The capital of France, Paris, is a major city in northern France and the political, cultural, and economic center of the country.\"\\n  },\\n  \"state\": {\\n    \"country\": \"France\",\\n    \"region\": \" Île-de-France\",\\n    \"AFP codes\": \"FRA\",\\n    \"longitude\": 2.2765,\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"famous landmarks\": [\\n      \"Eiffel Tower\",\\n      \"Notre-Dame Cathedral\",\\n      \"Sénat Palace\",\\n      \"Château de la Defensive\"\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON includes the capital city (\"Paris\"), its population (as of 2023, an estimated 3.5 million), its state context ( Île-de-France), and some details about its geographical location, AFP codes, longitude, latitude, and notable landmarks.', 'meta_info': {'id': 'e59af4df6da544a5bf12323d0d294f97', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 667, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.4828572273254395}}</strong>"
