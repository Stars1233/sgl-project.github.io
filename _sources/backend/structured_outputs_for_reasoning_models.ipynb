    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

They mentioned they want to use specific functions, so I should stick to that. First, I need to figure out which functions to use. They have 'get_current_weather' and 'get_current_date'. <br><br>I should probably start by getting the current date since that's straightforward. The function 'get_current_date' requires a timezone parameter. The user is in New York, so I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone. That means I'll call get_current_date with that parameter.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I'll need to use 'get_current_weather'. The city is New York, but I also need the state abbreviation. New York is NY, so the state parameter should be 'NY'. The unit isn't specified, but I'll default to Fahrenheit since that's a common preference for many users. So the parameters for get_current_weather will be city: 'New York', state: 'NY', unit: 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>Wait, but the user didn't specify the unit, so I should probably include it in the parameters. Alternatively, if the function allows default values, I can set unit to 'fahrenheit' as a default. Looking at the function parameters, it's required to specify, so I have to include it.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll first call get_current_date with the timezone parameter. Then, I'll call get_current_weather with city, state, and unit parameters. I need to make sure the JSON format is correct, with each parameter as a key and the value inside quotes. I'll separate the two function calls with a line break so it's clear and follows the format the user specified.<br><br>I should also remember to include the sources where I got the information, but since I'm using predefined functions, the sources might not be necessary. The user just wants the commands, so I'll stick to that.

I know that the capital of a country is typically the main city where government offices are located. For France, I think the capital is Paris because I\\'ve heard it mentioned a lot. I remember seeing a big clock in the city, maybe it\\'s the clock tower in the Eiffel Tower area. \\n\\nI\\'m not exactly sure about the population number, though. I think cities in France can have large populations. Paris is famous as a major city, so I\\'d guess it\\'s one of the larger cities globally. Maybe something like six million or more? I\\'ve heard other big cities in France like Lyon or Marseille, but their populations are smaller. \\n\\nLet me think if I\\'ve heard any specific statistics. I think I\\'ve heard that Paris has a population around 12 million, but I\\'m not totally certain. Also, populations can change over time, so that number might be outdated. Maybe I should check some recent data, but since I can\\'t access the internet, I\\'ll go with what I remember.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the capital is Paris, and the population is approximately twelve million. I should present this information in JSON format, making sure to label the capital and population correctly. I should probably include just those two pieces of information as keys in the JSON object. \\n\\nWait, is the population exact or an estimate? I think it can vary, so using an approximate number makes sense. Also, the population figure I\\'m recalling is from a couple of years ago, so it might have changed slightly since then. But for general purposes, twelve million should be a reasonable figure. \\n\\nSo in JSON, it would be something like {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 12000000}. Yeah, that seems straightforward. I should make sure the syntax is correct, using quotes around the strings and commas to separate the key-value pairs. No need to include extra information unless asked.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 12000000\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'ec9195b52c944552b363bb3e2fcb93c0', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 439, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.025819540023804}}</strong>"
