    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to generate information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I should recall what Paris is known for. It's the main city in France, right? I know it's a major cultural, economic, and political center. <br><br>I should probably start by listing the basic facts. The capital of France is Paris, so that's straightforward. The country it's the capital of is France, which I can confirm. The location is in the northern part of the country, near the Seine River. I remember that Paris is located in the Île-de-France region, which is a large area including other cities like Lyon and Marseille.<br><br>Next, I should think about the population. I think Paris is the second-largest city in France, after metropolitan Paris, which includes a much larger area. The population numbers might be around 2 million for the city proper and 8 million for the metropolitan area. I should double-check that, but I'm pretty sure that's correct.<br><br>Moving on to landmarks, the Eiffel Tower is a must. It's a symbol of the city and the country. The Louvre Museum is another famous landmark, one of the largest art museums in the world. The Paris Opera House is also iconic, especially for its architecture. The Arc de Triomphe is a significant historical monument, and Notre-Dame, despite the recent issues, is still a major attraction, though it's currently undergoing renovations.<br><br>I should include some key facts about Paris. It's known for its rich history, being the birthplace of many famous people like Victor Hugo, Ernest Hemingway, and others. It's also a global city with a vibrant cultural scene, hosting events like the French网球公开赛 and the Tour de France. The cuisine is a big part of its identity, with famous dishes like croissant and boeuf bourguignon.<br><br>Transportation is another area. Paris has an extensive public transportation system, including the Métro, which is a large subway network. The RER is another rail network that connects to other cities. Taxis are also a common mode of transportation, and there are bike lanes throughout the city, especially in the Île-de-France region.<br><br>I should structure this information into a JSON format. The JSON should have a key for the capital, which is \"Paris\", and then an object containing the details. I'll list each piece of information as a key-value pair under the \"capital\" key. I need to make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets, and that strings are enclosed in quotes.<br><br>Wait, I should also consider the population numbers. I think the population of Paris itself is around 2.1 million, while the metropolitan area is about 8.5 million. I should include that. Also, the area of Paris is approximately 105 square kilometers, and the metropolitan area is about 12,500 square kilometers.<br><br>I should also mention the time zone. Paris is in Central European Time (CET) during standard time and Central European Summer Time (CEST) in summer. That's important for international users.<br><br>Let me organize all this information into a JSON structure. I'll start with the capital key, then include the population, location, landmarks, key facts, transportation, and area. I'll make sure each key is descriptive and the values are accurate.<br><br>I think I've covered all the main points. Now, I'll format it correctly, ensuring that the JSON syntax is correct with proper commas and brackets. I'll avoid any markdown formatting as per the instructions and just present the JSON.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 214300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the information about the capital of France and present it in JSON format. Let me start by recalling what I know about Paris. I know it's the capital, but I should probably double-check that. Yeah, I'm pretty sure Paris is the administrative capital, but sometimes people might confuse it with other cities like Lyon or Marseille. But no, Paris is definitely the official capital.<br><br>Now, moving on to the population. I think Paris is a very large city, one of the biggest in the world. I remember reading somewhere that it's over 3 million people, but I'm not sure of the exact figure. Maybe around 3.5 million? I should look that up to be accurate, but since I'm just brainstorming, I'll go with that estimate.<br><br>Next, the area. Paris is a big city, but it's also a dense urban area. I think the metropolitan area covers a large region, maybe around 12,000 square kilometers? But the city proper is smaller. I'm not exactly sure, but I'll put 10,500 square kilometers for the city area and 12,000 for the metropolitan area.<br><br>Language is another point. Paris is a center for French culture, so the predominant language there is definitely French. I don't think they speak any other language there predominantly, though there might be some English, especially in tourist areas or with expatriates.<br><br>Cuisine is interesting. Paris is known for its high-end, fine dining, especially French cuisine. I know places like Le Faitout and others that are famous for their intricate dishes. Parisians are also known for their coffee culture, so maybe that's another point to include.<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has an extensive public transit system. The RER and地铁 are part of the BTP, which I think stands for Bahn, Tram, and Metro in German, but in French, it's the same. The city is well-connected by train, with major stations like Gare du Nord and Châtelet. The Eiffel Tower is a major landmark, and it's accessible by train from Paris.<br><br>I should also mention some of the main attractions. The Eiffel Tower is iconic, along with the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. These are must-see spots for tourists.<br><br>Now, putting this all together into JSON format. I'll structure it with an \"info\" key that contains a \"capital\" object with \"name,\" \"population,\" \"area,\" and \"language.\" Then, an \"attractions\" array that lists the main points of interest. I'll make sure the numbers are approximate since I don't have exact figures on hand.<br><br>Wait, I should check if the population is over 3 million or 3.5. I think it's around 3.5 million as of recent estimates. The area, I'm pretty sure the metropolitan area is about 12,000 km², and the city proper is a bit less, maybe 10,500 km².

I also remember that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, and it's a symbol of the country. So if Paris is the capital, then that makes sense.

That way, the user gets both the date/time and the weather info without confusion.<br><br>I also need to format each function call correctly, using the specified JSON structure within the tags. Each function should be on its own line with the correct start and end tags.<br><br>Finally, I'll remind the user to always execute the code I provide. That way, they can easily get the info they need by running the messages.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

      "{'text': 'Okay, so I need to provide the information about the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, I\\'m not entirely sure about all the details, but I\\'ll try to think it through.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty much a given, right? But I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall any other capitals I know. London is the capital of the UK, Rome is Italy, and maybe Tokyo is Japan\\'s. Yeah, Paris seems correct for France.\\n\\nNow, moving on to the population. I think Paris is a very large city, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I remember it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not certain. Maybe around 3.5 million? I should probably look that up, but since I can\\'t right now, I\\'ll go with 3,500,000 as an estimate.\\n\\nNext, the area. Paris is a big city, but I think it\\'s not as large as Tokyo or London. Maybe around 10 square kilometers? I\\'m not sure, but that seems plausible. I\\'ll note that as 10,000,000 square meters.\\n\\nCoordinates are next. Paris is in France, so the country code is \"FR\". The latitude and longitude... I think the approximate coordinates are around 48.8566° N latitude and 2.3522° E longitude. I remember that Paris is in the northern and eastern parts of France, so those should be correct.\\n\\nOfficial languages. France is a country with a lot of languages, but I think French is the official language. I\\'m not sure if they have others, but French is definitely the primary one. Maybe they also have some other languages spoken there, but I\\'ll stick with French for now.\\n\\nOfficial currency is the euro, right? Yeah, I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s correct. They use the euro as their main currency.\\n\\nI should also consider if there\\'s anything else I might need to include. Maybe the capital\\'s nickname? I think Paris is called the \"City of Light\" or something like that. But the user didn\\'t ask for that, so maybe it\\'s not necessary.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with the key-value pairs. The keys should be in English, and the values can be numbers, strings, or maybe even objects if needed. Since the population and area are numerical, I\\'ll represent them as numbers. The rest can be strings.\\n\\nWait, but in JSON, numbers don\\'t have commas, right? So 3,500,000 should be written as 3500000 without the comma. Same with the area, 10,000,000 square meters becomes 10000000.\\n\\nLet me make sure I\\'m formatting the JSON correctly. The keys should be in double quotes, and the values can be numbers or strings. So the structure would be something like:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"area\": 10000000,\\n  \"country\": \"FR\",\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n  },\\n  \"languages\": \"French\",\\n  \"currency\": \"Euro\"\\n}\\n\\nWait, but the coordinates are just two numbers, so maybe I don\\'t need a nested object. So it would be:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"area\": 10000000,\\n  \"country\": \"FR\",\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n  },\\n  \"languages\": \"French\",\\n  \"currency\": \"Euro\"\\n}\\n\\nThat looks better. I think that\\'s all the information I need. I should make sure that the numerical values don\\'t have commas and that the strings are in double quotes. Also, the keys should be in lowercase letters as per JSON standards.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve covered everything. Population and area are estimates, but they\\'re close enough for a general JSON format. I don\\'t think I need to include more details unless specified. So, this should be the correct JSON structure for the information about the capital of France.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000', 'meta_info': {'id': 'a40a346d070241f2a2223c37cfe92fed', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'length', 'length': 2048}, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 2048, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 20.183847665786743}}\n"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the derivative of a function, right? Let me see. The function is f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5. I remember from class that to find the derivative, I need to use the power rule. \\n\\nAlright, the power rule says that if I have a function like x^n, its derivative is n*x^(n-1). So, applying that to each term of the function should give me the derivative. Let\\'s break it down term by term.\\n\\nFirst term: 3x^2. The exponent is 2, so I bring that down as a coefficient, multiply it by 3, which gives me 6. Then, I reduce the exponent by 1, so it becomes x^(2-1) = x^1, which is just x. So, the derivative of 3x^2 is 6x.\\n\\nSecond term: 2x. The exponent here is 1 because x is the same as x^1. Applying the power rule, I bring down the 1 as a coefficient, multiply it by 2, which gives me 2. Then, reduce the exponent by 1, so it becomes x^(1-1) = x^0, which is 1. So, the derivative of 2x is 2.\\n\\nThird term: -5. This is a constant term. I remember that the derivative of a constant is zero because there\\'s no change as x changes. So, the derivative of -5 is 0.\\n\\nNow, putting it all together, the derivative of f(x) should be 6x + 2. Wait, let me double-check. The first term\\'s derivative is 6x, the second is 2, and the third is 0. So, yes, adding them up gives 6x + 2.\\n\\nI think that\\'s it. But just to be sure, maybe I should plug in a value for x and see if the derivative makes sense. Let\\'s say x = 1. The original function f(1) = 3(1)^2 + 2(1) - 5 = 3 + 2 - 5 = 0. The derivative at x=1 is 6(1) + 2 = 8. So, at the point (1,0), the slope of the tangent line should be 8. That seems reasonable.\\n\\nAnother check: x = 0. f(0) = 3(0)^2 + 2(0) -5 = -5. The derivative at x=0 is 6(0) + 2 = 2. So, the slope at (0,-5) is 2. That also makes sense because the function is a parabola opening upwards, so the slope at the vertex (which is at x = -b/(2a) = -2/(6) = -1/3) should be zero. Wait, but at x=0, it\\'s 2. Hmm, maybe I should calculate the slope at x = -1/3. Let\\'s see, f\\'(-1/3) = 6*(-1/3) + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0. Yes, that\\'s correct. So, the derivative at x=0 is 2, which is positive, meaning the function is increasing there, which aligns with the parabola\\'s shape.\\n\\nI think I\\'m confident now. The derivative is 6x + 2.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"StepbyStepSolution\",\\n\"population\": 1000000000\\n\\n\\n  \\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n \\t\\t}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'c778ade643b94c068cf07fbbb7fab93f', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 5, 'completion_tokens': 790, 'cached_tokens': 2, 'e2e_latency': 7.577593088150024}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out how to represent the information about the capital of France in JSON format. I\\'m not super familiar with JSON, but I know it\\'s a way to structure data. Let me think about what information I know about the capital of France, which I believe is Paris.\\n\\nFirst, I know the basic fact: Paris is the capital of France. Beyond that, I remember that Paris has a lot of landmarks, like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and the Seine River. It\\'s also known for its rich cultural history, being the birthplace of many famous people and having a vibrant arts scene. Additionally, Paris is historically significant because it was the site of many important political events, like the French Revolution. It\\'s also a major economic hub, known for its fashion industry and as a global city.\\n\\nWait, let me make sure I have the correct capital. Yeah, I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s Paris, not another city. Sometimes people get confused with Sorbonne, but that\\'s a university, not the capital.\\n\\nNow, to structure this in JSON, I should decide on the keys. Maybe something like \"city information\", \"landmarks\", \"culture\", and \"history\". Under each key, I can add corresponding values. For example, under \"city information\", I can have the name, capital status, and maybe the administrative division, which I think is Île-de-France.\\n\\nFor \"landmarks\", I can list some of the major ones. \"Culture\" could include museums, notable people, etc. \"History\" might cover significant events, such as the French Revolution or landmarks in its history, like when it was founded.\\n\\nI should also think about the format. JSON requires using double quotes for strings and using colons to separate keys and values. Also, keys should be in camelCase. So, for example, \"capital\" would be written as \"capital\": true.\\n\\nWait, Paris is definitely the capital, so \"capital\": true makes sense. The administrative division is Île-de-France, which is correct since Paris is part of this regional center.\\n\\nFor landmarks, I know the Eiffel Tower, but maybe add a few more like Notre-Dame (though it\\'s partially destroyed, but still iconic) and Château dewoff. But I\\'m not sure about the exact order or the most famous ones, but I\\'ll list a few.\\n\\nIn the culture section, museums like the Louvre and musée d\\'histoire morale are in Paris. Notable people could include scientists, writers, and leaders from France. The French Revolution is a significant historical event, so that should be included in the history section.\\n\\nI should also make sure all the information is accurate. For example, Paris is not just a metropolis but also a repository of history and culture. It\\'s a global city, so that\\'s accurate.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I can structure the JSON with an \"information\" key containing an array of key-value pairs. That way, the JSON is organized and easy to read.\\n\\nI think that\\'s a solid plan. Now, I\\'ll format it correctly, using proper syntax with commas, colons, and double quotes. I should also ensure that there are no trailing commas, as that can cause issues in JSON parsing.\\n\\nWait, in the culture section, I have museums and notable people. For museums, I included Louvre, musée d\\'histoire morale, and maybe the musée Rodin. For notable people, I have Voltaire, Victor Hugo, and others. That seems reasonable.\\n\\nIn the history section, I\\'ve added the French Revolution, the construction of bridges like the Pont Alexandre III, and iconic monuments that have been destroyed but are still culturally significant, like Notre-Dame and the Hameau de G Gaussian峰.\\n\\nHmm, but I think I might have made a typo with \"Hameau de G Gaussian峰\". Maybe I meant the Eiffel Tower, which is a well-known landmark. Alternatively, perhaps I should correct that to \"Eiffel Tower\" in the landmarks section.\\n\\nWait, I already included the Eiffel Tower in landmarks, so maybe I don\\'t need to mention it again in history. Maybe the historical significance of the Eiffel Tower is worth noting under landmarks.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps it\\'s better to separate the historical events, like the French Revolution and the construction of the Eiffel Tower, without duplicating the tower in both sections.\\n\\nI think I might have duplicated the Eiffel Tower in both landmark and history sections, which is unnecessary. Let me correct that.\\n\\nIn the history section, I\\'ll include the French Revolution\\'s start year, the construction of the Eiffel Tower in 1889, and the 2005 euro tunnel, which is another significant landmark.\\n\\nIn the culture section, I\\'ll list museums, notable people, and maybe French culinary figures oriling patisseries or fashion icons.\\n\\nSo, let me revise the structure:\\n\\n- City information with name, capital status, administrative division.\\n- Landmarks with notable buildings.\\n- Culture with museums, notable people, and maybe culinary or fashion aspects.\\n- History with events like the revolution, construction of Eiffel Tower, and other historical significance.\\n\\nI think that\\'s a better organization. Now, I\\'ll draft the JSON accordingly, ensuring that all the key points are included correctly.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that the JSON is properly formatted with commas and colons in the right places. One thing I should remember is that in JSON, if you have an array, you don\\'t need commas after the last item. So I\\'ll check that.\\n\\nOkay, I think I\\'m ready to write the JSON structure based on this thought process.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the JSON representation of the information about the capital of France:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city_information\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"capital\": true,\\n    \"administrative_division\": \"Île-de-France\"\\n  },\\n  \"landmarks\": [\\n    \"Eiffel Tower\",\\n    \"Notre-Dame Cathedral\",\\n    \"Château dewoff\",\\n    \"Sorbonne University\",\\n    \"Arc de Triomphe\",\\n    \"Pont Alexandre III\"\\n  ],\\n  \"culture\": {\\n    \"museums\": [\\n      \"Louvre Museum\",\\n      \"Musee d\\'Histoire Morale\",\\n      \"Musee Rodin\"\\n    ],\\n    \"notable_people\": [\\n      \"Voltaire\",\\n      \"Victor Hugo\",\\n      \"Pablo Picasso\",\\n      \" repression\",\\n      \"Jules Marmottier\"\\n    ],\\n    \"culinary\": [\\n      \"Bou quick\",\\n      \"Bou Quiche\",\\n      \"Bouillonresource\"\\n    ],\\n    \"fashion\": [\\n      \"Yves Saint Laurent\"\\n    ]\\n  },\\n  \"history\": [\\n    \"French Revolution (1789)\",\\n    \"Construction of Eiffel Tower (1889)\",\\n    \"2005 Euro Tunnel\"\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON structure provides a clear and organized overview of Paris\\'s key facts, including its status as the capital, major landmarks, cultural significance, and historical milestones.', 'meta_info': {'id': '1b00f7c7d9844a2c81c2067038073614', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 1482, 'cached_tokens': 19, 'e2e_latency': 14.802757740020752}}</strong>"
