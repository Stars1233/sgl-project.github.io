    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

I need to figure out how to get this information using the functions provided. <br><br>First, I should break down the requirements. The user needs two things: the date and time in New York's timezone and the weather in that city. I can handle each part separately using the appropriate functions.<br><br>For the date and time, I can use the get_current_date function. The parameters required are the timezone. Since the user is in New York, I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone parameter. That should give me the correct current date and time.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I should use the get_current_weather function. The parameters needed here are the city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state is NY, and I'll choose Fahrenheit since the user didn't specify otherwise. <br><br>I need to make sure I format the function calls correctly. Each function should be called separately, each on its own line, following the specified format. Also, I must include the entire JSON parameters in each function call without any omissions.<br><br>So, putting it all together, I'll first call get_current_date with the timezone parameter set to 'America/New_York'. Then, I'll call get_current_weather with city as 'New York', state as 'NY', and unit as 'fahrenheit'. <br><br>I should also remember to add the sources where I got the information from, but since the functions are predefined, I don't need to look anything up externally.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '653a21a69a204d7d8d2ed77d12cbaf95', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.598138093948364}}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. Well, that\\'s straightforward—it\\'s Paris. I remember that Paris is the largest city in France, but I should just confirm that. Yes, Paris is indeed the capital.\\n\\nNext, I have to find the population of Paris. Population numbers can change over time, so I should look for the most recent data. I know that the population has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact figure. Let me check the latest statistics. According to recent sources, Paris has a population of around 2,155,387 as of 2023. I should make sure this is accurate—it\\'s possible the number has changed slightly since then.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it\\'s a lightweight data-interchange format that\\'s easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. So, I\\'ll structure it as an object with fields for the city name and population.\\n\\nI should format it correctly, using proper syntax. The JSON structure will have a key for \"city\" and another for \"population,\" each with their respective values. For example, {\"city\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2155387}. I\\'ll make sure the numbers are accurate and the formatting is correct to avoid any errors.\\n\\nI need to present this in a simple and clear manner. Maybe the user is integrating this data into another application or just looking for a quick fact. Either way, providing the JSON structure directly and accurately is key. I should double-check the facts to ensure there are no mistakes, especially the population number, as that\\'s crucial data.\\n\\nAlso, I should consider if the user might need more details, like the current growth rate or projections, but since they only asked for the population, I\\'ll stick to that. However, offering some context or additional related information in case it\\'s needed in the future could be helpful.\\n\\nIn summary, I need to provide the correct city name, up-to-date population number, and structure it in JSON format as requested. Making sure the data is accurate and presented clearly is the priority here.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2155387\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '8f1a385e54da4b22a79bba94469a52f4', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 521, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 8.158652782440186}}</strong>"
