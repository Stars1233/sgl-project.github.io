    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

New York is in EST, so the timezone parameter should be 'America/New_York'. <br><br>I should make sure to structure each function call correctly.

For get_current_date, it's {\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}.<br><br>I need to call both functions one after the other because the user wants both the date and the weather.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'f681da1696054786b254f04f211fac9a', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.903101921081543}}</strong>"

First, I need to identify the capital of France, which I know is Paris. Next, I should gather the most recent population data. I\\'m pretty sure the latest available data from 2023 estimates Paris\\'s population to be around 2.16 million. \\n\\nNow, considering the format, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data interchange format that\\'s easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It\\'s structured as key-value pairs. So I\\'ll need to create an object with keys like \"city_name\", \"population\", and maybe others like \"country\" and \"area_sqm\" if needed.\\n\\nWait, the user just asked for the capital, so maybe they only need city-specific info. But including the country and area might add more context. I\\'ll include those too. So structuring it as an object with those properties makes sense. \\n\\nI should make sure the numbers are accurate. Population figures can change, so it\\'s best to reference the latest exact figure. I recall that Paris\\'s population is approximately 2,165,000 as of recent data. The administrative area might be around 105 square kilometers, and the number of inhabitants is usually in thousands, so 2165 thousand would make it 2,165,000.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have keys for city name, population, country, and area in square meters. I\\'ll format it neatly, using commas appropriately to separate the key-value pairs. It\\'s also a good idea to add an English summary of the data at the end, so the user knows what the JSON contains.\\n\\nI should avoid any markdown and keep the JSON clean. Double-checking the numbers is important to ensure accuracy. Maybe mention in the summary that these figures are approximate and based on recent estimates. That should cover the user\\'s request comprehensively.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city_name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2165000,\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"area_sqm\": 105000000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object contains information about the capital city of France (Paris), its estimated population, country, and administrative area in square meters.', 'meta_info': {'id': 'db2224428bea410cb601440e5c16e904', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 503, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.819474697113037}}</strong>"
