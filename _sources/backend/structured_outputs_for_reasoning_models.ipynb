    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to generate information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format. Hmm, where do I start? Well, I know that Paris is the main city in France, but I'm not exactly sure about all the details. Let me think about what information is typically included about a city's capital.<br><br>First, the name of the city is obviously Paris. Then, the country it's the capital of, which is France. I remember that Paris is the largest city in France, but I'm not sure about its population. I think it's a big city, maybe around 2 million people? I'm not certain, though. I should probably look that up, but since I'm just brainstorming, I'll go with that for now.<br><br>Next, the location. Paris is located in the northern part of France, specifically in the Île-de-France region. I think it's on the Seine River, which is a major river there. The Eiffel Tower is in Paris, so that's a key landmark. I should include that.<br><br>Moving on to government information. Paris is the administrative center, so it has a city hall. I'm not sure about the exact address, but I think it's in the Latin Quarter. The mayor's name, I'm not sure, but maybe it's something like Anne Hidalgo? I think I've heard that name before. The council, or Conseil municipal, is probably the local government body.<br><br>Language-wise, Paris is a major French-speaking area, but I know that English is widely used, especially in tourist areas. So, the predominant languages would be French and English.<br><br>Cuisine is another aspect. Paris is famous for its French food, like baguettes, croissants, and wine. I should mention some of the popular dishes, maybe something like Le Faitout, which is a type of bread, and perhaps some iconic restaurants or chefs.<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has a well-developed public transit system. I think the RER is a rapid transit network, and maybe the Métro as well. There are also buses and trams. I'm not sure about the exact routes, but I know they're extensive.<br><br>Culturally, Paris is rich with museums, galleries, and art. The Louvre is a major museum there, and it's known for masterpieces like the Mona Lisa. The Musée d'Orsay is another famous one. There are also theaters and operas, like the Théâtre de la Scala.<br><br>Historically, Paris has been a significant city. It was the capital of France for a long time, and it's the birthplace of many famous people, like Voltaire and Victor Hugo. The Eiffel Tower was built there, and there's the Arc de Triomphe, which is a famous monument.<br><br>I should also mention some notable landmarks beyond the Eiffel Tower, like the Notre-Dame Cathedral, which unfortunately had some issues with fire recently, but it's still a major attraction. The Arc de Triomphe is another one, and maybe the Javel, which is a statue of Julius Caesar.<br><br>In terms of economy, Paris is a financial hub. I think the Paris Stock Exchange is there, and there are major banks based in the city. The French Ministry of Finance is also located there.<br><br>I'm not sure about the exact population, but I think it's over 2 million. Maybe around 2.2 million? I should probably check that, but for now, I'll go with that.<br><br>Putting this all together, I need to structure it in JSON format. The JSON should have a \"name\" field, \"country\", \"population\", \"location\", \"government\", \"language\", \"cuisine\", \"transport\", \"culture\", \"history\", and \"economy\". Each of these fields will have their respective details.<br><br>Wait, I should make sure that the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values should be properly formatted. Also, the commas should be placed correctly between the key-value pairs.<br><br>Let me try to outline the JSON structure:<br><br>{<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"country\": \"France\",<br>  \"population\": \"2,200,000\",<br>  \"location\": {<br>    \"region\": \"Île-de-France\",<br>    \"coordinates\": [\"48.8566°N\", \"2.3522°E\"]<br>  },<br>  \"government\": {<br>    \"administrative_center\": \"City Hall\",<br>    \"mayor\": \"Anne Hidalgo\",<br>    \"council\": \"Conseil municipal\"<br>  },<br>  \"language\": [\"French\", \"English\"],<br>  \"cuisine\": [\"Baguette\", \"Croissant\", \"Wine\", \"Le Faitout\"],<br>  \"transport\": {<br>    \"system\": \"RER, Métro, Bus, Tram\",<br>    \"stations\": [\"Châtelet\", \"Saint-Lazare\", \"Le Marais\"]<br>  },<br>  \"culture\": {<br>    \"museums\": [\"Louvre\", \"Musée d'Orsay\"],<br>    \"theaters\": [\"Théâtre de la Scala\"],<br>    \"art\": [\"Impressionism\", \"Post-impressionism\"]<br>  },<br>  \"history\": {<br>    \"monuments\": [\"Eiffel Tower\", \"Arc de Triomphe\", \"Notre-Dame Cathedral\"],<br>    \"famous_people\": [\"Voltaire\", \"Victor Hugo\"]<br>  },<br>  \"economy\": {<br>    \"sectors\": [\"Finance\", \"Tourism\", \"Technology\"],<br>    \"institutions\": [\"Paris Stock Exchange\", \"Banque de France\"]<br>  }<br>}<br><br>Wait, I think I might have missed some details. For example, the coordinates of Paris are approximately 48.8566°N and 2.3522°E. Should I include that? Maybe, but it's optional. Also, the population figure is approximate, so I can include it as a string with a comma.<br><br>I should also make sure that the JSON is properly formatted, with commas separating the key-value pairs and no trailing commas. Each object within the JSON should be properly enclosed in curly braces.<br><br>I think that's a solid structure. Now, I'll format it correctly, ensuring that each key is a string, and the values are appropriately formatted. I'll also make sure that the JSON is valid by checking the syntax.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 22000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the information about the capital of France and present it in JSON format. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about France. I know that Paris is the capital, but I should double-check that to be sure. Yeah, Paris is definitely the administrative and cultural center of France.<br><br>Now, I need to gather more details about Paris. Let me think about its location. Paris is located in the northern part of France, right? It's in the Île-de-France region. I remember that it's an island, so that's an important geographical feature. The coordinates are something like 48°51′N 2°28′E. I think that's correct, but I should make sure. Maybe I can visualize it on a map—Paris is in the north, near the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River.<br><br>Next, I should consider the history of Paris. It's been a major city for centuries. I know that during the French Revolution, Paris was the center of the revolution, and it's still a significant cultural and political hub today. It's also a global city, attracting millions of visitors each year.<br><br>Economically, Paris is a major financial and business center. I believe it's home to many multinational corporations and financial institutions. The Paris Stock Exchange comes to mind, and there are a lot of big companies based there. The city is also known for its fashion industry, with some of the world's most famous brands having headquarters in Paris.<br><br>Culturally, Paris is rich with art, literature, and history. The Louvre Museum is one of the world's largest art museums, and it's located in Paris. There's also the Musée d'Orsay, which is another major cultural institution. The city has a vibrant nightlife, with famous bars and clubs. I think places like Le Marais and Montmartre are known for their lively nightlife and artistic scenes.<br><br>Demographically, Paris is a large city, but it's also one of the most densely populated in the world. The metropolitan area covers a vast area, extending beyond the city limits into the outer suburbs. The population is diverse, with people from many different countries and backgrounds living there.<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has an extensive public transit system, including the Métro, which is a highly efficient subway network. There are also buses, trams, and trolleys that serve the city. The Seine River has several bridges and ferries that connect different parts of the city.<br><br>I should also mention some notable landmarks. The Eiffel Tower is a must-see, and the Arc de Triomphe is another iconic structure. The Notre-Dame Cathedral is a major religious site, though it's had some recent renovations and changes due to the fire that occurred in 2019.<br><br>In terms of language, Paris is a city where French is the official language, but it's also a multicultural city. People from around the world speak English, Spanish, German, and other languages there, contributing to a very international atmosphere.<br><br>I think I've covered the main points. Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. I'll start with the basic information: name, location, and status. Then, I'll add historical, economic, cultural, demographic, transportation, and notable landmarks sections. Each section will have relevant details under subkeys.<br><br>Wait, I should make sure that the JSON syntax is correct. I'll use proper braces, commas, and quotation marks. Also, I'll ensure that the keys are in lowercase letters as per JSON standards. Let me organize the information step by step.<br><br>First, the capital object will have properties like name, location, and status. Then, each additional section will be an object with its own properties.

I need to figure out how to call the appropriate functions to get this information.<br><br>First, I should use the 'get_current_date' function. This function requires a timezone parameter.

I'll make sure to format the parameters correctly as a JSON object inside curly braces.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I'll use the 'get_current_weather' function. This function needs a city and state parameter. New York's state abbreviation is NY, so I'll set city to 'New York' and state to 'NY'. I'll again structure the parameters as a JSON object.<br><br>I need to make sure each function call is separate and follows the specified format. So, I'll first reply with the date function and then the weather function, each on their own line. I'll also include the sources for each function call to ensure transparency and credibility.<br><br>Wait, does the user need both pieces of information in one go? They mentioned wanting both current date/time and weather. So yes, two separate function calls are needed. I should present them clearly, each with their respective parameters and responses.<br><br>I should also check if there are any required parameters I'm missing. For 'get_current_date', the timezone is required. For 'get_current_weather', city and state are required.

Okay, the capital is definitely Paris. So I need to structure this information into JSON.\\n\\nHmm, I should start with a basic object. Maybe the \"Name\" field would be \"Paris\" and another field \"Currency\" with the value \"Euro\". That seems straightforward.\\n\\nBut wait, Paris is a pretty big city. I should include more details. An \"Area\" field in square kilometers would be good. I think Paris has about 105 square kilometers, but it\\'s not just land area, so maybe mention urbanized area as well.\\n\\nI also remember that Paris is significant culturally and historically. So perhaps adding a \"Significance\" field would add value. Maybe something like paris is a global city known for its history, culture, etc.\\n\\nCurrency is easy, popping back to that. Also, I should include the population, but the current data might be outdated. Maybe note that it\\'s an approximation and subject to change.\\n\\nTransport systems are important too. Paris has a lot of efficient public transport systems like buses and metro. I can add that as another field.\\n\\nEconomically, Paris is a major hub with GDP and employment statistics. Including that would show its economic importance. Let me jot down, GDP about 3.5 trillion euros and employment over 10 million jobs.\\n\\nEducation-wise, Paris has top universities and research institutions. That\\'s a big part of its reputation. Also, it\\'s known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll make a JSON object with each of these pieces of information. Starting with basic facts, then area details, currency, population, transport, significance, education, and landmarks.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON syntax is correct. Each key in quotes, separated by commas, no trailing commas. The entire thing enclosed in curly braces. Okay, formatting it neatly so it\\'s readable.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll add a comment line for context, letting the user know that Paris is indeed the capital of France.

They want the information of the capital of France in JSON format, then convert that into a JSONP object. Also, they need a JSON array with 5 different cities in France, each having population and area. Finally, they want a JSON object that combines both the capital info and the array of cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital. So, the JSON for the capital should include its name, country, population, area, and whether it's the capital.

      "  \"area\": 100000, // Again, approximate values.\n",
      "  \"capital\": true\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to convert this into a JSONP object. JSONP typically wraps the JSON in a function and adds a \"func\" key. So, it would look like:\n",

      "{\n",
      "  \"func\": function() {\n",
      "    return {\n",
      "      \"name\": \"Paris\",\n",

      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but JSONP often uses a function that returns the JSON object. So, the structure is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, moving on to the array of 5 cities in France. I need to list 5 cities, each with their population and area. I should pick well-known cities to make it accurate. Let me think of some major cities in France:\n",

      "2. Marseille\n",
      "3. Toulouse\n",
      "4. Lille\n",
      "5. Nîmes\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to find their approximate populations and areas. I might not have exact numbers, so I'll have to estimate or use known approximate values.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Lyon: Population around 400,000, area about 100 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Marseille: Population around 600,000, area about 150 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Toulouse: Population around 300,000, area about 120 square kilometers.\n",

After that, I have to create a JSON array with five different cities in France, each including their population and area. Finally, I need to combine both the capital info and the array into a single JSON object.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me recall what the capital of France is. I think it's Paris. Yes, Paris is the capital city of France. Now, I need to find the population and area of Paris. I'm not exactly sure about the current numbers, but I remember that Paris has a large population and a significant area. Let me check my memory: I think the population is around 2 million and the area is about 105 square kilometers. I should verify these numbers to be accurate, but for the sake of this exercise, I'll go with these figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to represent this information in JSON format. The structure should include the name, country, population, and area. So, the JSON object for the capital would look like this:\n",

      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, moving on to the JSONP object. JSONP typically involves wrapping the JSON object in a function and providing a callback. The syntax is usually function() { return JSON; }. So, converting the above JSON into a JSONP object would involve adding a function wrapper. It would look something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "function() {\n",

      "}\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, onto the second part: creating a JSON array of five different cities in France, each with their population and area. I need to choose five cities. Let me think of some major cities in France. I know Paris, but I need four more. Maybe Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, and Nice? Or maybe I should include some other cities to make it diverse. Let me check their populations and areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Paris: As mentioned, population around 2 million, area about 105 km².\n",
      "2. Lyon: I believe Lyon has a population of around 400,000 and an area of about 100 km².\n",
      "3. Marseille: Population is around 1.5 million, area about 100 km².\n",
      "4. Toulouse: Population is around 300,000, area about 100 km².\n",
      "5. Nice: Population is around 600,000, area about 200 km².\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should verify these numbers because I might be off. For example, Nice's area is actually larger, maybe around 200 km², but the population is a bit lower. Let me adjust accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the JSON array would look like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "[\n",
      "  {\n",
      "    \"name\": \"Paris\",\n",

      "Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll need to decide which keys to use. The user mentioned population, area, and official language, so I can include those. Also, since the capital is Dublin, I should include that as a key as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the keys I'll use are probably \"capital\", \"population\", \"area\", and \"official_language\". Each of these will have their respective values. Let me make sure about the numbers. The population is approximately 5 million, so I'll write that as 5000000. The area is about 9,400 square kilometers, so that's 9400. The official language is English, so that's straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON structure should look like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": \"Dublin\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 5000000,\n",
      "  \"area\": 9400,\n",
      "  \"official_language\": \"English\"\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that covers everything the user asked for. They wanted the JSON with key-value pairs, and I included the capital, population, area, and official language. I should double-check if there are any other details they might need, but based on the information given, this should be sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user also mentioned that the population is approximately 5 million, the area is about 9,400 square kilometers, and the official language is English. I included all of these in the JSON. I don't think I need to add anything else unless they specify more details, but they didn't ask for more information, so I think this is all that's needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure that the JSON syntax is correct. The keys are in double quotes, the string values are in double quotes, and the numbers are without quotes. The commas are in the right places, and the structure is properly formatted. I don't see any syntax errors here.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to summarize, the JSON object will have four key-value pairs: capital as \"Dublin\", population as 5000000, area as 9400, and official_language as \"English\". This should fulfill the user's request accurately.\n",

      "Next, I should consider the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so it must have a large population. I think it's around 2.1 million people, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the most recent figure. Maybe I should double-check that, but for now, I'll go with that estimate.\n",

      "I should structure this information into a JSON format. I'll need to use key-value pairs for clarity. So, I'll start with \"Capital\" as the main key, and then include subkeys like \"Name\", \"Location\", \"Population\", \"Language\", and \"Cuisine\".\n",
