    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I immediately thought about what the capital is—Paris. I know Paris is both the capital and the most populous city in France, so that's a given.<br><br>Next, I considered the population. I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let me break this down. First, I should identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital.\\n\\nNow, the user wants information and population. That means I need to find the current population and some key facts about the capital city. I should make sure the data is up-to-date. As of my knowledge cutoff, Paris had a population of around 2,215,000. That\\'s the most recent exact figure I have.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll need to choose the most relevant keys. Population makes sense as a key, but I should also include some essential details about the city. Let\\'s think about urban statistics: area in square kilometers, which I believe is around 105.3. Also, population density is important, so maybe 21,000 people per square kilometer. I should include these to give a clear picture of Paris\\'s demographics.\\n\\nUrbanization rate is another key point because it shows how much of the country\\'s population lives in cities. Paris has a high urbanization rate, often cited around 86.5%. Including rebels and landmarks like the Eiffel Tower could add more depth, but I should be concise so the JSON isn\\'t too bulky. Maybe just a couple of key points.\\n\\nI need to present this in a clear and organized JSON structure. Starting with the main population data, then adding city statistics, urbanization, and some notable facts. That should cover what the user is asking for. I\\'ll make sure each value is correctly assigned under the respective keys.\\n\\nWait, is there any other information that the user might find useful? Maybe distance to major attractions or something, but that\\'s more about location and travel, which might be beyond the scope of population and general info. I think focusing on demographics and some concise facts is better.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON should look something like the response I provided, with all the key points and the current population. I should double-check the numbers again to ensure accuracy. Population figures can change yearly, so it\\'s best to use the latest available data but I don\\'t have access to real-time data, so I rely on my last update.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, structured the information into key-value pairs, included necessary statistical data, and formatted it correctly in JSON. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2215000,\\n  \"population_notes\": \"The population figure is approximate and may vary depending on the source and year.\",\\n  \"urban_area\": {\\n    \"area_sq_km\": 105.3,\\n    \"density\": 21000,\\n    \"urbanization_rate\": 86.5\\n  },\\n  \"urban_statistics\": {\\n    \"eiffel_tower\": \"The Eiffel Tower is a well-known landmark in Paris.\",\\n    \"rebel\": \"Paris is a city of contrasts, with busy streets and.raveling\\n            historical sites, as well as diverse neighborhoods.\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'f2afa159d25a4e7b9ec99ce0e1310895', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 697, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.741110563278198}}</strong>"
