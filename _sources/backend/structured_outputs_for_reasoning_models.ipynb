    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '93cf9cf68f3c464ca7ab24d35860bc44', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.676816940307617}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I just received a query from a user asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me first make sure I understand exactly what they\\'re asking for. \\n\\nOkay, the capital of France is definitely Paris. So the user wants the population stats for Paris, probably as a summary. But wait, the query is a bit unclear. They mention \"information and population,\" so maybe they want more than just the population figure. Do they want other details about Paris as well, like its location or maybe some key facts?\\n\\nI should consider that the user might be looking for a structured data format, which JSON is perfect for. They likely want something easy to parse and integrate into other applications or reports. But I also need to ensure I don\\'t add too much unless it\\'s directly relevant. For example, providing the area, the governor, notable landmarks, and languages spoken there could add value beyond just the population.\\n\\nNow, I should look up the latest population data for Paris. I remember that the population figures can change from year to year. For instance, as of 2022, Paris had a population estimate around 2,128,000. But I should verify that to make sure it\\'s accurate.\\n\\nNext, I should structure the JSON accordingly. It makes sense to have an \"information\" object that includes key details about Paris, such as its location in France, the capital status, area, and other notable aspects like landmarks, languages, and key institutions. Then, a separate \"population\" object with the current population estimate and the year of the latest data.\\n\\nI should also include units for population, probably keeping it as a number without units specified since the user didn\\'t mention units in their query. But in general practice, populations are listed with numerals.\\n\\nWait, should I include the city limits or the metropolitan area? The user didn\\'t specify, so safer to stick with the city proper and mention that the metropolitan area population is higher. Including some notable landmarks can give the user a nice overview, so that\\'s a plus.\\n\\nAdditionally, maybe the user is looking for a more comprehensive view of Paris, not just population. So adding those extra fields in the \"information\" key would make the data more useful.\\n\\nI should also think about the format. JSON is a straightforward format, so the structure should be clear with appropriate key-value pairs. Using proper capitalization and syntax is essential to avoid errors when parsing.\\n\\nI wonder if the user has any specific tools in mind for using this JSON data. Maybe they\\'re integrating it into a web app or a report. Knowing that, it\\'s crucial to present the data clearly so it can be easily consumed by whatever system they\\'re using.\\n\\nAnother thought: population can vary based on sources (like the latest census or estimates). I should mention that the estimate is from a reliable source, maybe the latest census year, to inform the user that the figure is based on available data.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the user wants the most recent data, I might need to check the latest available estimates. But since I don\\'t have real-time access, sticking to the most recent reliable source is the best approach.\\n\\nAlso, considering the unit of area, providing it in square kilometers is standard for such data. It\\'s useful for context, knowing how big the city is.\\n\\nI should make sure that all the facts are accurate and up-to-date. Double-checking the population figure, especially if it\\'s different from what I know, is important to avoid giving incorrect data.\\n\\nIn summary, the response should be a JSON object with an \"information\" key containing various facts about Paris and a \"population\" key with the current estimate, ensuring clarity and accuracy while keeping the information useful for the user\\'s potential needs beyond just the numbers.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France (Paris), including its population, in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"information\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"capital\": \"Yes\",\\n    \"region\": \" Île-de-France\",\\n    \"area\": \"12.51 square kilometers\",\\n    \"year\": \"2022\",\\n    \"current\": \"2,128,000\",\\n    \"landmarks\": [\\n      \"Eiffel Tower\",\\n      \"Notre-Dame Cathedral\",\\n      \"Louvre Museum\",\\n      \"Arc de Triomphe\",\\n      \"Gaulleatabou FASTO\"\\n    ],\\n    \"official亲手 languages\": [\\n      \"French\"\\n    ],\\n    \"notable_institutions\": [\\n      \"École Polytechnique\",\\n      \"Palissard Family Diet\",\\n      \"Viart de Batignolles\"\\n    ],\\n    \":governor\": \"The Governor of Paris\",\\n    \"wikipedia_id\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris\"\\n  },\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"year\": \"2022\",\\n    \"estimate\": \"2,128,000\",\\n    \"unit\": \"Residents\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object provides a structured summary of Paris, including population details and some notable facts about the city.', 'meta_info': {'id': '928663892dee40778fd84bfe6bb0367f', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 1056, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 10.52036452293396}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Alright, so I need to figure out the information and population of the capital of France, which is Paris. Okay, let's start by recalling what I know about Paris. I know it's the largest city in France and one of the most important cities in Europe. But when it comes to population, I'm not exactly sure. I think it's a big city, so maybe over 3 million people? I've heard numbers like 3.5 million before, but I'm not 100% certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I remember that the population figures can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. So the number might vary a bit depending on the source and the year it's measured. I think the latest official data is probably from 2021 or 2022. I've heard that Paris is getting a bit crowded, so maybe the population is a little higher than 3.5 million now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider how the population is counted. Is it just the metro area or the entire urban area? I believe in many cases, the population figures for cities include all urban areas, not just the metro. So Paris's population might be higher when including the broader urban area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think about other capitals. For example, the capital of Brazil is Brasília, and its population is around 6 million. The capital of the UK is London, which is much larger, over 9 million. The capital of the USA is Washington, D.C., but its population is concentrated in the city, maybe around 7 million. So Paris being around 3.5 million seems reasonable, but I'm not entirely sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the time period. If it's from a few years ago, the population might have been slightly different. I think the population is generally increasing, especially in the metro area, as more people move there for jobs and education. So maybe the latest data shows it's a bit higher than 3.5 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm trying to remember if I've heard specific numbers in the news. I think the official population of Paris, including the urban area, is around 3.6 million. But I'm not 100% confident. To be precise, I should probably look up the exact figure, but since I can't access external information right now, I'll go with my best estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, the capital of France is Paris, its population is approximately 3.6 million people, and the largest city in France is also Paris. That makes sense because the metro area is around 2.3 million, but the urban area is bigger. I think I've heard that the urban area is around 3.6 million, so I'll go with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also note that the population can vary depending on the source. Some might report the metro area, others the urban area. It's important to specify which one is being referred to. In this case, since Paris is the capital and the largest city, and the urban area is significantly larger than the metro area, it's probably best to mention both to give a complete picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Paris is the capital and largest city in France, and its population is approximately 3.6 million, considering the urban area. The metro area is around 2.3 million. This information is based on my current knowledge, and I should always refer to official sources for the most accurate and up-to-date figures.\n",
