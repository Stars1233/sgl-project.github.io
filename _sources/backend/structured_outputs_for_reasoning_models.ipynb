    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. \\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I\\'ll stick to that. \\n\\nLastly, I\\'ll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '7f0ce831290447349427897750277cf0', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 412, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 3.7965075969696045}}\n"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. <br><br>Next, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

So, I need to provide the population numbers. But I should consider both the metropolitan area and the city proper. Typically, the metropolitan area has a larger population, maybe around 21 million, while the city alone is around 8.6 million. I should check if these numbers are up-to-date because population figures can change year by year. \\n\\nI should format this information into a JSON structure. That makes sense, as JSON is a common format for data and is easy to parse. I\\'ll include the city name, metropolitan area population, and city proper population. It\\'s important to make the JSON clean and well-structured so that the user can easily access the data. \\n\\nI also need to ensure that the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks. Maybe I should include comments or a brief description, but looking at previous examples, sometimes users just want the data without extra explanations. But adding a simple note might help clarify the information if needed. \\n\\nWait, the user just asked for the information and population. Do they want it within a JSON object? Yes, that seems likely. So, I\\'ll structure it with keys like \"city\", \"metropolitan_area_population\", and \"city_proper_population\". I should make sure the numbers are accurate and up-to-date. If I\\'m not 100% sure about the exact numbers, it\\'s better to mention that the data is approximate, but the initial response uses exact figures.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON will have the city name, and then the two population figures as specified. That should meet the user\\'s request effectively.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France, along with its population, in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"metropolitan_area_population\": 21832000,\\n  \"city_proper_population\": 8623080\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON structure includes:\\n- The name of the city (`Paris`).\\n- The approximate population of the metropolitan area of Paris (`21,832,000`).\\n- The approximate population of the city proper (`8,623,080`).\\n\\nNote: The population figures are approximate and may vary slightly depending on the source or year.

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out how to help the user who asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's a given, but I should make sure I'm not missing anything. Paris is the administrative capital, but sometimes people confuse it with the economic capital, which is also Paris, but driven by the financial sector. But for this question, it's the administrative capital we're concerned with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is the most populous city in France, but exact numbers can change each year. I think the population is around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Wait, I recall that the population was about 2,170,000 as of 2020, but it's been growing since then. Maybe around 2,190,000 or 2,200,000 now. I should look up the latest data to be accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the user asked for the information and population in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. It uses key-value pairs. So, I should create an object where one key is \"capital\" with the value being \"Paris,\" and another key \"population\" with the number.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, using quotation marks around strings and commas properly between key-value pairs. Since the population is a number, it doesn't need quotes. I also need to decide on the exact number to use. Let's say I go with the latest estimate, maybe around 2,190,000 for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON would look like this: a dictionary with \"capital\" as \"Paris\" and \"population\" as 2190000. I should present this clearly so the user can easily copy it or use it in their application.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I just thought of something. Sometimes, population numbers can vary based on the source—like from the census, estimates, or projections. I should probably mention that the population figure is an estimate and might change. That way, the user is aware and the information is more accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure there are no typos in the JSON syntax. Missing a comma or a quote can break the entire structure. So, I'll double-check that each key is correctly formatted and the values are accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the steps are: identify the capital, find the latest population number, structure it into JSON with appropriate keys and values, and ensure the syntax is correct. That should cover everything the user needs.\n",
