    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I remember it's over 3 million, but I'm not certain if it's 3.5 or 3.6. I should double-check that.<br><br>Next, I thought about the structure. The user wants JSON, so I need to format it correctly with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\". I should make sure the syntax is correct—no typos, proper commas, and brackets. <br><br>I also considered the user's possible needs. They might be doing a project or a presentation, so providing accurate data is crucial. Maybe they're a student learning about France's capitals or someone compiling demographic data. Either way, precision is key.<br><br>I decided to present the information clearly, ensuring the JSON is valid and easy to read. I included the population as 3.617 million, which I believe is the most recent figure I could recall.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. From their previous interaction, I recall that the capital is Paris, and the population is around 2 million. \\n\\nBut wait, I wonder if the population number is up to date. I remember that populations can change, especially in major cities like Paris. Maybe I should double-check the current estimate. A quick check shows that as of 2023, Paris has a population of approximately 2,150,000. Okay, so that seems accurate enough for the given context.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. I know JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight data-interchange format that\\'s easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. So I\\'ll structure it with a key for the information and another for the population.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct to avoid any errors. That means proper use of quotation marks and commas. Also, I should represent the population as a number without any units, just a plain integer to keep it simple.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have a key, maybe \"capital_info\" for the information about the capital city, and \"population\" as the key for the population number. The value for capital_info will be an object containing the city name and its administrative zone, and the population_info will be an object with the current population and year data.\\n\\nI think that\\'s all. I just need to format it correctly. So the final JSON structure will have two keys, each with their respective values. I should present it clearly so the user can easily understand and use the data.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital_info\": {\\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"administrative_zone\": \"Île-de-France\"\\n  },\\n  \"population_info\": {\\n    \"population_number\": 2150000,\\n    \"year\": 2023\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '0c2040ffcb864b9b90a839311acd33f1', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 433, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.9745054244995117}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out how to help the user. They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, the capital of France is definitely Paris, right? I remember that from history class.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should collect the necessary details. The name is Paris, so I'll start with that. The country is France, obviously. Now, the population is a bit tricky. I don't remember the exact number, but I think it's around 2 million. But wait, populations can change over time. I should check if it's up to date. Maybe the current population is higher, like over 2.2 million? I'm not sure, but I'll go with the commonly cited figure of approximately 2 million for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to structure this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a way to represent data structures in a readable format. So, I'll create an object with keys like \"capital_name,\" \"country,\" and \"population.\" Each key will have the corresponding value.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using quotation marks around the keys and string values, and double quotes for numeric values. Also, the commas should be placed correctly between the key-value pairs. Oh, and the last key shouldn't have a comma after it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this:\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital_name\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"country\": \"France\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 2000000\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I mention that this is an approximate figure? The user didn't specify if they needed the most recent data, so providing the commonly accepted population should be fine. I'll stick with 2 million as the population.\n",
