    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '3690c14bcf484e06a9f32beb5ba18706', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.58665132522583}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let me think. First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty common knowledge, so I should get that right.\\n\\nNow, the user wants it in JSON format. JSON, right, that\\'s JavaScript Object Notation. It\\'s a way to structure data. So I need to make sure the information is organized properly within the JSON structure.\\n\\nThey mentioned \"information,\" which is a bit broad. I guess they want more than just the population. Probably some key facts about the capital. Let me see, Paris is the largest city in France, right? It\\'s known for a lot of landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. Also, it\\'s a major cultural and economic hub. That could be useful information to include.\\n\\nAs for the population, I think the latest data is around 2 million. But wait, I should double-check that to be accurate. Sometimes there are fluctuations. Also, Paris is divided into several arrondissements, ordistricts. There are 20 arrondissements in total. Listing a few like le Marais, Madeleine, Bitphileca would be good points to note unless the user specifies more.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I think the JSON should have a key for general info, which includes the city name, country, status as capital, and population. Then another key for notable facts, including its significance, cities, and maybe the metro area population. Plus, maybe an interesting fact about Paris to add a bit more depth.\\n\\nI need to make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets in the right places. Each key should have the correct data without any typos because that can cause issues in programming environments. So, I\\'ll structure it with \"capital\" containing the info, \"factoids\" for notable points, and maybe \"city_population\" for the number, but looking back, the user specifically asked for \"population of the capital,\" so maybe just a single \"population\" key under the general info.\\n\\nWait, in the example response I provided earlier, there\\'s a \"city_population\" key but nothing under \"general info.\" Maybe the user\\'s query included \"capital of France,\" so perhaps in the JSON, I can have a key like \"capital\" containing all the details. But I should clarify that. Hmm, actually in the previous response, I included a \"factoids\" key, which includes population. Maybe that\\'s more appropriate to follow the user\\'s instruction precisely.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the population figure to be a key in the main data. Let me think: if I structure it as \"capital\" containing \"general_info,\" \"factoids,\" and maybe \"population.\" To avoid confusion, perhaps I should make it clear and follow any specific structure the user might expect.\\n\\nI should also ensure the population number is up to date. Let me confirm the latest estimate. As of 2023, Paris\\' population is roughly 2,154,563. But if I\\'m not sure, maybe I should check a reliable source. However, since this is my thought process, I might not have access to that right now, so I\\'ll go with the commonly cited number around 2.1 million.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should clearly present the necessary information. I should also keep the language simple and ensure it\\'s correctly formatted. I don\\'t want to include any unnecessary complexity. Maybe I can outline the structure first:\\n\\n- A key like \"capital\" which holds the main data.\\n\\n- Within that, perhaps two sub-keys: \"general_info\" for city name, country, status, and population; \"factoids\" for other interesting points and cities in the metro area.\\n\\nYes, that seems balanced and informative. So, the field would look something like:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"general_info\": {\\n      \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n      \"country\": \"France\",\\n      \"status\": \"the national capital\",\\n      \"population\": \"approximately 2.1 million people\"\\n    },\\n    \"factoids\": [\\n      \"Paris is the largest city in France\",\\n      \"Known as the \\'City of Light\\' due to numerous landmarks\",\\n      \"Home to major cultural institutions\"\\n    ],\\n    \"city_population\": 2154563  // or keep it as a string if not precise\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nI think this covers the user\\'s request comprehensively, providing both the general information and some notable facts, along with the population data.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format, presented in a structured and organized manner:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"general_info\": {\\n      \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n      \"country\": \"France\",\\n      \"status\": \"the national capital\",\\n      \"population\": \"approximately 2.1 million people\"\\n    },\\n    \"factoids\": [\\n      \"Paris is the largest city in France\",\\n      \"Known as the \\'City of Light\\' due to numerous landmarks\",\\n      \"Home to major cultural institutions\"\\n    ],\\n    \"city_population\": 2154563\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON format provides a clear and concise overview of the capital, including its general information, notable facts, and city population.', 'meta_info': {'id': '79c500c9a0354870bfb4d45edb28c3f1', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 1113, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 10.558741807937622}}</strong>"
