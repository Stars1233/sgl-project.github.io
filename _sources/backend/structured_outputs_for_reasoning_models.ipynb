    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'b22d952a4dff419b854cd9cccc151fc1', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.782058477401733}}</strong>"

I know that Paris is the capital of France, so that's where I should be focusing on. \\n\\nNow, I need to find out how many people live there. I'm not exactly sure off the top of my head, but I remember it's a major city with a large population. Maybe I can think of other large cities in similar countries. For example, I know that Tokyo is very populous, with millions of people, and megacities like Tokyo or Cairo in Egypt are home to tens of millions. \\n\\nI think Paris has a population over 30 million, maybe around 35 million. But I'm not 100% certain. Sometimes cities have varying statistics depending on the source and the year. I should double-check this, but since I can't access the internet or databases right now, I'll go with my best estimate. \\n\\nWait, I think I've heard before that Paris's population is around 22 million. No, that seems low for a capital of such a big country and a major transportation hub. Maybe it's higher. Let me think. I recall something about the Île-de-France metro region, which is a larger area including Paris and other surrounding cities, and it has a population in the 21 million mark. But Paris alone might be a bit higher than that. \\n\\nPerhaps I should consider that the city proper doesn't include the suburbs, so maybe the city center doesn't exceed 2 million, but the metro area is around 21 million. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because I think the metro area is larger. Let me try to recall specific numbers. I believe the population of Paris is over 30 million, maybe around 3,100,000. Or maybe 2,900,000? Hmm.\\n\\nI think I've heard the figure updated a few times, and I think it's around 3,100,000, but I'm really not sure. It's a bit confusing because different sources might calculate city limits differently. Some include the outer suburbs, others focus strictly on the urban area. \\n\\nWait, after a quick sanity check, I recall that in 2021, Paris had a population of approximately 3,160,000. That seems reasonable because it's a large city with significant development and attracts a lot of residents. However, I'm still a bit uncertain if that number is accurate or if it's changed more recently. \\n\\nAlternatively, if I'm considering metropolitan areas, the Île-de-France is home to around 12.5 million people. But I think the question specifically asks for the capital's population, not the larger metropolitan area. So sticking with Paris, I'll go with around 3.1 million. \\n\\nBut wait, maybe the figure is even higher. I think the population might be closer to 3.5 million. I'm getting a bit confused with the numbers, but I believe it's around that. \\n\\nIn summary, after considering different sources and factors, I think the population of Paris, the capital of France, is approximately 3.1 million people. But I'm still a bit unsure because population figures can vary based on how they're counted.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France, Paris, has a population of approximately 3.1 million people.\", 'meta_info': {'id': '0d89118a851441cbb667beac1804f163', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 722, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.533207654953003}}</strong>"

I think it's somewhere around 2 million, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should think about other capitals and their populations for comparison. For example, Germany's capital Berlin has about 3.5 million, and Italy's capital Rome is around 2.8 million. So maybe Paris is a bit lower than that. Wait, I think I've heard that Paris is one of the most populous cities in Western Europe, but I'm not sure of the exact number.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider whether the population figure includes just the city proper or the metropolitan area. Sometimes, the metropolitan area includes neighboring towns and suburbs, which can significantly increase the population. If the figure I'm looking for includes the entire metropolitan area, the number would be higher. But I think the standard population figures for cities usually refer to the city limits, not the entire metropolitan area. Hmm, this could be a bit confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so I'm going to try to recall or estimate the population. I think Paris has a population of around 2.2 million to 2.4 million people. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I can think of recent events or news that might have mentioned the population. For example, I remember reading that Paris is the second-largest city in France after metropolitan巴黎, which includes its suburbs. Wait, that doesn't make sense because metropolitan areas are usually bigger. Maybe I confused the metropolitan area with the city proper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try to break it down. The city of Paris, which is just the administrative center, might have a population around 2.1 million. But when you include the entire metropolitan area, which includes a lot of the surrounding districts, the population could be higher, maybe around 3 million or more. I think that's how it works in other countries as well, like how London's population is around 9 million, but the metropolitan area is much larger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify. The question asks for the population of the capital, so that would be the city of Paris itself, not the metropolitan area. So I should look for the population figure of the city of Paris. From what I remember, Paris has a population of approximately 2.2 million people. But I'm not entirely certain if it's 2.2 million or maybe slightly different, like 2.1 million or 2.3 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've heard that Paris has a population of about 2.2 million, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should try to find a reliable source or a recent statistic to confirm this. Since I can't access the internet, I'll have to rely on my memory. Okay, I'll go with 2.2 million for now, but I should note that the exact number might vary depending on the source and whether it's the metropolitan area or just the city proper.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together, the JSON format should include a key with the name of the city and another key with the population. The population should be a number. So it would look like:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 2200000\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm a bit unsure about the exact population number. Maybe it's around 2.16 million or 2.22 million. I should try to be as accurate as possible. If I had to estimate, I think it's roughly 2.2 million. So I'll stick with that for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, another thought: I think I've seen a figure where Paris has a population of about 2.17 million. Maybe that's more precise. So perhaps I should use 2170000 as the population. That seems more accurate than 2.2 million. I think that's a better estimate. So the JSON would then be:\n",
