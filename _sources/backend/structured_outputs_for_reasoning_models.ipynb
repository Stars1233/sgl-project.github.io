    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I remember it's over 3 million, but I'm not certain if it's 3.5 or 3.6. I should double-check that.<br><br>Next, I thought about the structure. The user wants JSON, so I need to format it correctly with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\". I should make sure the syntax is correct—no typos, proper commas, and brackets. <br><br>I also considered the user's possible needs. They might be doing a project or a presentation, so providing accurate data is crucial. Maybe they're a student learning about France's capitals or someone compiling demographic data. Either way, precision is key.<br><br>I decided to present the information clearly, ensuring the JSON is valid and easy to read. I included the population as 3.617 million, which I believe is the most recent figure I could recall.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

No, I'm pretty sure France's capital is Paris. Maybe I should double-check that to be certain. Yeah, Paris is where the government is located, and that's the capital.

JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see... Yes, according to the latest data, the population is approximately 2,174,300 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \"country\". The city is Paris, the population is the number I found, and the country is France.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. The entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. I\\'ll format it properly to avoid any syntax errors.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have the city, population, and country. I\\'ll present this to the user, making sure it\\'s clear and easy to understand. I don\\'t think the user needs anything more detailed, so this should suffice.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need additional information, like the area or age distribution, but since they only asked for population, I\\'ll stick to that.

Let me break this down step by step to make sure I get it right.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out what the capital of France is. I remember it\\'s Paris, but I should double-check that to be sure. Yeah, Paris is definitely the capital because I\\'ve heard it a lot. It\\'s where all the important government buildings and landmarks are.\\n\\nNext, I have to include some information about Paris in the JSON. Maybe I should include the city\\'s coordinates. I think the latitude is around 48.85 and the longitude is approximately 2.29 degrees. I should make sure these numbers are accurate because they\\'re crucial for location. I\\'ll look up the exact values to ensure there\\'s no mistake.\\n\\nNow, the population. This is the tricky part because populations can change over time. I know that the population of Paris is a big city, but the exact number can vary. I\\'ll have to check recent data. From what I recall, it\\'s roughly around 2.1 million people. But maybe it\\'s a bit different now, so I should verify the current estimate. Okay, the latest data I found says the population is approximately 2,153,093 as of 2023. That seems correct.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure should have a key like \"capital_information\" and include the city\\'s name, location, and population. I\\'ll format it properly with proper syntax—commas in the right places, and proper indentation to make it readable.\\n\\nWait, should I include more details in the information? Maybe the area or some notable landmarks? But the user specifically asked for information and population, so I think sticking to those is best. Maybe adding the area could be extra, but I should stick to the request unless the user says otherwise.\\n\\nSo, summarizing: the JSON object will have a key \"capital_information\" with a structure that includes the city name, location details (coordinates), and population. I\\'ll make sure the numbers are accurate and up-to-date to provide the user with reliable information.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital_information\": {\\n    \"city_name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"coordinates\": {\\n      \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n      \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n    },\\n    \"population\": 2153093\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'd526de9afcb24cafb0ac9923edec8bc5', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 519, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.910323858261108}}</strong>"

Paris has a long history, with its origins dating back to the Stone Age when the area was inhabited by various tribes, including the Parisii, who later became the Paris. Over the centuries, Paris has been a hub of innovation, art, and intellectual thought, making it a significant cultural and intellectual center. The city's architecture is\n"

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France and provide its information and population in JSON format. Let's start by recalling what I know. I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty much a given, but just to make sure, I'll think about the major cities in France. Paris is definitely the most prominent one, so I'm pretty confident about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to gather information about Paris. The user asked for the capital of France, so I already have that as Paris. Next, I should include the population. From what I remember, Paris has a large population, but I don't know the exact number. I think it's in the millions, maybe around 2 million? I'm not entirely sure if it's exactly 2 million or if it's a bit more or less. I should check my facts to make sure I don't give an incorrect number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user provided a response earlier that stated Paris has a population of about 2.2 million. That seems right, but I want to confirm. I'll try to recall recent data. I think the population growth in France has been steady, and Paris, being the largest city, has seen a significant portion of that growth. So, 2.2 million sounds accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the user included the area of Paris, which I believe is around 105 square kilometers. I think that's correct because I've heard it referred to as the \"City of Light\" and it's known for being a very dense urban area. The population density, therefore, would be quite high, which makes sense given the population and the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I should consider if there are any other details that the user might find useful. The user included a website for more information, which is helpful. But since the question was specifically about the JSON format, I should stick to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON structure should have the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris,\" then another key \"information\" which is an object containing \"city,\" \"population,\" and \"area,\" and possibly \"population_density.\" The population is 2.2 million, the area is 105 km², and the population density would be calculated as population divided by area. So, 2,200,000 divided by 105 km². Let me do that calculation: 2,200,000 ÷ 105 ≈ 20,952.38 people per km².\n",
      "\n",
      "I should round that to a reasonable number of decimal places. Maybe two decimal places for precision, so 20,952.38 people per km². But sometimes population density is given as a whole number, so perhaps 20,952 people per km².\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, putting all this into JSON format. The JSON structure should look like this:\n",

      "  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"information\": {\n",
      "    \"city\": \"Paris\",\n",

      "    \"population_density\": 20952\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user's initial example didn't include population density, so maybe I don't need to include it unless it's necessary. The user's response only had city, population, and area. So perhaps I should stick to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if I include all the details, the JSON would be more comprehensive. But the user's initial answer didn't include population density, so I'll follow that structure to maintain consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the final JSON would be:\n",
