    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I immediately thought about what the capital is—Paris. I know Paris is both the capital and the most populous city in France, so that's a given.<br><br>Next, I considered the population. I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out the information and population of the capital of France. Hmm, first, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s definitely right, even though sometimes people might confuse it with somewhere else. I\\'ve heard Paris mentioned a lot, like in movies and books, so it\\'s probably correct.\\n\\nNow, I need to find out how many people live in Paris. I think it\\'s a big city, so the population must be in the millions. I remember seeing news about it being over 9 million people, but I\\'m not entirely sure. Maybe I should verify that. But since I\\'m supposed to imagine being a student who hasn\\'t checked it yet, I\\'ll go with what I recall.\\n\\nI think the population number is around 9,600,000. But I\\'m not 100% certain. Let me try to break it down. Paris has a metropolitan area, which probably includes neighboring towns and suburbs. I think the metropolitan area is about 12 million people. But the city proper, including just the main downtown area, is around 9 million. That makes sense because sometimes people live in the suburbs outside the city limits, so the city itself might not be as populous.\\n\\nAlso, I remember that Paris is a very diverse city with different ethnic groups. So, the population figure should reflect that diversity. People from various countries and backgrounds live there, which might influence the numbers a bit. But I don\\'t think the total population is extremely high compared to other major global cities. Maybe somewhere around 9.6 million would be a reasonable estimate.\\n\\nWait, I\\'m not sure if it\\'s 9.6 million or 9.5 million. Maybe I should think about the exact figure. I think it\\'s approximately 9,600,000. That seems right. So, summarizing, the capital of France is Paris, and its population is roughly 9,600,000 people.\\n\\nI guess it\\'s important to note that this number can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. So, the figure I\\'m using is an approximate and probably from the most recent reliable sources. As a student, I might not have the capability to access real-time data, but for educational purposes, 9,600,000 is a good estimate to go with.\\n\\nAlright, I think I\\'ve got the information I need. Paris is the capital, and its population is about 9.6 million people.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is Paris, and its population is approximately 9,600,000 people.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 9600000\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '18db1636a1334add857d2fcad337e64f', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 574, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.571608781814575}}</strong>"
