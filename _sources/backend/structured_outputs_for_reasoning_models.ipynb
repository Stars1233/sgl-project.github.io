    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

Let me start by understanding the functions I can use. There's 'get_current_weather' and 'get_current_date'. <br><br>First, I think I need the date and time for New York. The function 'get_current_date' requires a timezone parameter. Since I'm in New York, I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone. I'll call that function with that parameter.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I need the current conditions in New York. The 'get_current_weather' function requires a city and state. New York's state is NY, so I'll provide 'New York' as the city and 'NY' as the state. I also need to specify the unit for temperature, so I'll choose 'fahrenheit' since that's what I'm more familiar with.<br><br>I should make sure to structure my function calls correctly. For the date, I'll call <function= get_current_date '{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>. For the weather, I'll use <function= get_current_weather '{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function>. This way, each function is called separately with the necessary parameters.<br><br>I wonder if I need to handle any dependencies or if these functions are reliable. The user mentioned to always execute Python code in messages, so I'm assuming the functions work as intended. I should also note the sources of the information, maybe mention that the data is from a reliable source like a weather API.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll explain that I'm getting the date and weather using the specified functions and include the necessary parameters in JSON format. I'll also add a note about the sources to ensure credibility.<br><br><br>content: To retrieve the current date and time in New York and the weather conditions there, I will use the provided functions. <br><br><function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function>  <br><br>Sources: The data will be sourced from a reliable weather and timezone API.</strong>"

Hmm, so first I need to figure out what they\\'re asking for. They\\'re specifically mentioning the capital, which is Paris, so I know they want data about that city.\\n\\nI should gather the key details. Paris\\'s population is around 2.2 million, but I remember it\\'s a big, growing city. It\\'s good to note that the figure can vary depending on the source and the year. Also, Paris is home to a lot of landmarks—like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and the Arc de Triomphe. These are probably important points for the user.\\n\\nSince the user requested the information in JSON format, I\\'ll need to structure it properly. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll list the population, major attractions, and notable landmarks as separate keys. I should make sure the formatting is correct to avoid any errors when they use the JSON.\\n\\nI wonder if they need more details. They might be doing a project or a presentation, so providing a clear and concise response is probably best. I\\'ll keep it straightforward without unnecessary jargon. Also, it\\'s important to mention that the population figure is approximate to reflect that it can change over time.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll make sure each key is in quotation marks and the values are properly formatted. Reviewing the JSON to ensure there are no typos is crucial. I think that covers all the bases. Hopefully, this helps the user with whatever they\\'re working on.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": \"Approximately 2.2 million\",\\n  \"major_attractions\": [\\n    \"Eiffel Tower\",\\n    \"Louvre Museum\",\\n    \"Arc de Triomphe\"\\n  ],\\n  \"notable_landmarks\": [\\n    \"Seine River\",\\n    \"Javert\\'s Needle\",\\n    \"Gardens of Tuileries and Tuilierines\"\\n  ]\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'b92952458c384785aef881cdd1ec3e7e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 435, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.287088632583618}}</strong>"

      "\n",
      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query about the capital of France's population. Let me start by understanding exactly what they're asking for. The user wrote, \"Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty standard, but I should double-check to make sure I'm not mistaken. Paris is indeed the administrative capital, though sometimes people might confuse it with another city like Lyon or Marseille. But in terms of being the capital, Paris is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user specifically asked for the population. I'm aware that population numbers can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. I remember that major cities in France often have population estimates in the hundreds of millions. Paris is one of the largest urban areas in the world, so I'm pretty confident the population is in that range. But I should provide a specific number to be accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recall that in recent years, Paris has had fluctuating populations. There was a time when the population was around 21 million, but it's been growing. Maybe around 2023, the population is approximately 21.6 million. I think that's a figure I've heard before, but I'm not entirely sure. To be safe, I should confirm this information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I should think about the exact source. The World Bank and recent censuses are reliable sources for population data. If I can access that information, I can provide the most accurate figure. Alternatively, I can use my existing knowledge up to 2023. I believe the population was around 21.6 million in 2020, and it might have increased a bit in 2023 due to recent growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the user asked for the information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It's commonly used for transmitting data in web applications. So, I need to structure the data as a JSON object.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user also mentioned \"information and population.\" I'm not exactly sure if they want just the population or other related information as well. But since they specified both, I should include population and maybe other relevant details, like the metropolitan area population. I think the metropolitan area of Paris is larger, maybe around 12 million? I'm not certain about that number, so I should be cautious. Alternatively, perhaps the metropolitan area includes other nearby towns and regions, making it a bit larger than the urban center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me also consider if there's any other information that could be relevant. Maybe the area in square kilometers? That could be useful, but the user didn't specify. Since they asked for population and information, perhaps including some additional stats about the city would be helpful, but I'll stick to what's asked unless I have more info.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with a key for \"capital\" which is \"Paris,\" another key for \"population\" with the number I believe is accurate, and perhaps another key for additional information like the metropolitan area population. But I should make sure the data is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, another thought: sometimes population figures are given for the urban area versus the metropolitan area. I think the urban area might be around 12 million, and the metropolitan area could be larger. I should check if that's correct. If I'm unsure, maybe I should go with the urban area population since that's more commonly referenced for the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in the JSON, I can have an \"information\" key containing various statistics, and a \"population\" key with the urban population. Let me outline the structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 21600000,\n",
      "  \"information\": {\n",
      "    \"official_name\": \"The City of Light\",\n",
      "    \"founded\": \"1347\",\n",
      "    \"area\": {\n",
      "      \"square_kilometers\": 10.55\n",
      "    },\n",
      "    \"urban_population\": 1200000,\n",
      "    \"metropolitan_area\": 12700000\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that doesn't seem right. I think I mixed up some numbers. Earlier I thought the urban population was around 12 million, but maybe that's the metropolitan area. Let me correct that. If the urban population is 12 million, then the metropolitan area might be higher. Maybe around 12.7 million. Alternatively, I might have confused the metropolitan area population with another figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I need to clarify this. Upon checking, I realize that the metropolitan area of Paris, which includes satellite towns like La Défense, is around 12.7 million people. The urban area, which is more strictly defined, is about 12 million. So, I should structure the JSON accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the JSON should have the city's name, population, and information about its area, founding year, urban population, and metropolitan area population. Let me put that together accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The urban population is actually around 12 million, and the metropolitan area is about 12.7 million. So, I should reflect that in the JSON. Also, the area of Paris is approximately 10.55 square kilometers.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the final JSON would look like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 21600000,\n",
      "  \"information\": {\n",
      "    \"official_name\": \"The City of Light\",\n",
      "    \"founded\": \"1347\",\n",
      "    \"area\": {\n",
      "      \"square_kilometers\": 10.55\n",
      "    },\n",
      "    \"urban_population\": 1200000,\n",
      "    \"metropolitan_area\": 12700000\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, I think the urban population in 2023 is around 12.6 million. Maybe I should update that to 12600000. Also, the metropolitan area is larger, perhaps 12.7 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I should check the exact numbers to ensure accuracy. Let's say urban population is 12,600,000 and metropolitan area is 12,700,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the JSON becomes:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 21600000,\n",
