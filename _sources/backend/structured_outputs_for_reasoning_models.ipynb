    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'd8f17f0bb29f4c2581f4e122447d9c03', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.957168340682983}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking me for the capital of France and its population in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out who the user is and why they\\'re asking this. They might be a student working on a project, someone doing research, or just curious. JSON is a common data format, so they probably want a structured response that\\'s easy to parse or use in another application.\\n\\nI should start by confirming the capital. Paris is definitely the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Next, I need the population. I recall that as of recent estimates, Paris has a population over 3 million. To be precise, it\\'s around 3,500,000. I should double-check that from a reliable source to make sure it\\'s up to date, especially since population numbers can fluctuate yearly due to births, deaths, and migration.\\n\\nNow, structuring this information into JSON. The structure should be simple, with a key like \"capital\" and \"population.\" So it would look something like {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 3500000}. I should make sure the syntax is correct, using quotes and commas appropriately to avoid any errors.\\n\\nWait, should I include the units for the population? The user didn\\'t specify, but it\\'s good practice to include units for clarity. So I\\'ll write population as \"3,500,000\" instead of 3500000. That way, it\\'s clear it\\'s 3 million 500 thousand. \\n\\nI also need to make sure the JSON is properly formatted. I\\'ll avoid using any markdown since the user specified to keep it in JSON. Maybe they\\'re planning to use this data in a web application or a script, so proper formatting is crucial.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll present the JSON with the information. Keeping it concise and accurate is key. I don\\'t want to overcomplicate it because the user seems to just need a straightforward response. \\n\\nWait, do I need to mention that the population might vary slightly? Well, since the user is asking for the population, it\\'s better to provide an approximate number rather than an exact figure if it\\'s not precise. So, providing 3,500,000 as an estimate should be sufficient. If they need an exact figure, they can look it up another source, which is always a safe bet for accuracy.\\n\\nAlright, I think that\\'s all. Time to present the JSON response clearly and neatly.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": \"3,500,000\"\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '308a046762604071888192015c767f3e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 556, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 8.844036340713501}}</strong>"
