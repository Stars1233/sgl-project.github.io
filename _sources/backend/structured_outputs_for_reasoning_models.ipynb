    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '54c6dcf5eeec4e5c87dc08a014f3a9f2', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.971509218215942}}</strong>"

First, I need to determine what the actual capital is because that\\'s crucial. Paris is definitely the capital, right? I think so, but just to be sure. Yes, Paris is the administrative center but does Jacques famous the political and cultural one?\\n\\nNext, I should confirm the current population. I know that Paris has a changing population due to various factors like migration, new developments, etc. I recall the population is over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should look up the latest estimate to provide accurate information.\\n\\nConsidering recent data, I believe the population around 2023-2024 is around 2,199,757. That\\'s the official figure from the latest census, so I\\'ll go with that. It\\'s better to have an accurate number even if it\\'s an approximate value.\\n\\nNow, structuring the JSON. The user wants it in JSON format, so I should create an object that includes the necessary fields. I\\'ll include \"CapitalName\" as \"Paris,\" \"Capital bác moreover, and \"Population\" as the number. These are the key pieces of information they\\'re asking for.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON is correctly formatted, with proper commas and quotation marks. No trailing commas or missing braces to avoid any parsing issues. Also, it\\'s good practice to mention that the population figure is as of the latest available data, just in case someone references this information later.\\n\\nThinking about the user\\'s context, they might be using this data for a project, report, or maybe a presentation. Providing accurate and concise information is essential. Maybe they need just the facts without extra details, so keeping it straightforward is key.\\n\\nAdditionally, I should avoid any markdown formatting as per their request, just plain JSON. They probably want to integrate this into another system or application, so consistency is important. It\\'s also possible they\\'re not very familiar with JSON, so clarity in the response is necessary.\\n\\nIn summary, I\\'ll confirm the capital is Paris, state the population accurately, and present it in a well-structured JSON format without any unnecessary information or formatting issues.\\n</think>\\n\\nSure! Here\\'s the information in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2199757\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object contains the information about the capital of France and its population, as of the most recent estimates.', 'meta_info': {'id': 'fee929a1c5be4a7ab64a0ba2970a2a52', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 528, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 8.484715700149536}}</strong>"

JSON is a data format that's easy for computers to read, so I'll structure it with the key \"capital\" pointing to \"Paris\" and the key \"population\" pointing to 2160000. I should make sure the numbers are accurate and formatted correctly.\n",

      "I should also consider the user's possible intent. They might be looking for a quick data point for a project or a presentation. Since they asked for JSON, it's likely they'll be using this data in a program, so accuracy is crucial. I don't want to provide outdated or incorrect information.\n",

      "Another thought: should I include the country name in the JSON? The user didn't specify, but since they mentioned France, it's implied. Maybe they need it for context, but the query doesn't ask for it, so I'll stick to just the capital and population.\n",
