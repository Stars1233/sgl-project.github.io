    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Alright, so the user is in New York and wants to know the current date and time, along with the weather. Hmm, I should break this down into two separate requests. First, I need to get the current date and time for their timezone, which is New York. Then, I have to fetch the weather information for the same location.<br><br>Let me think about the functions available. There's 'get_current_date' which takes a timezone parameter. That seems perfect for the first part. Since New York is in the 'America/New_York' timezone, I'll need to pass that as the argument. No other parameters are needed for this function, so it's straightforward.<br><br>Next, the weather part. The function 'get_current_weather' requires the city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state is NY, and since the user didn't specify, I'll default to Celsius. I should make sure to structure the parameters correctly as a JSON object within the function call.<br><br>I need to make sure both function calls are correctly formatted. Each should be on its own line, starting with '<function' and ending with '</function>', with the parameters in between. Also, I should remember to include the sources where I got the information from, but since these are predefined functions, the sources might not be necessary unless I'm using any real-time data beyond what's provided.<br><br>Wait, the user mentioned that if I choose to call a function, I should only reply in the specified format. So I should present each function call separately, each on its own line, without any additional text. That way, the user can easily parse the information.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll first call 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter set to 'America/New_York'. Then, I'll call 'get_current_weather' with the city as 'New York', state as 'NY', and unit as 'celsius'. Each call will be enclosed within the start and end tags as specified.<br><br>I should double-check the syntax to ensure there are no typos. The JSON keys should be in double quotes, and the values should match the expected parameters. Also, make sure that all required parameters are included for each function.<br><br>Once both functions are correctly formatted and called, the user should receive the current date, time, and weather information for New York. That should fully address their query.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"celsius\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '4c9a5d155dc942b596f458804a64dc37', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.658093690872192}}</strong>"

Yes, Paris is definitely the capital.\\n\\nNext, I should find the most recent population data for Paris. The figure I recall is around 3.5 million, but I want to confirm if that\\'s up to date. Maybe around 2022, the population was approximately 2.1 million. Hmm, perhaps I confused years. I\\'ll need to look that up to be accurate, but for now, let\\'s go with 2.1 million as of 2022.\\n\\nSince the user wants this in JSON format, I\\'ll structure it properly. The key will be \"capital_information\" with an object containing \"name\", \"official_name\", and \"coordinates\". For the population, I\\'ll include \"population\" with \"current_value\" and \"last_updated_at\".\\n\\nI should note that the population figure is subject to change and might not reflect the latest data. It\\'s always good to mention that the information could be outdated. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should be clean and well-formatted.
