    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'e4e573c6e37d456b8e938df20b9030e8', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.782450437545776}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I need to figure out the population of the capital of France. Okay, first step, who\\'s the capital of France? From what I remember, it\\'s Paris. Yeah, that\\'s right. Paris is not only the capital but also a major city in France.\\n\\nNow, I need to find out the population of Paris. I think I\\'ve heard that Paris is a very populous city, but I\\'m not exactly sure about the exact number. I believe it\\'s in the hundreds of millions. Let me think, I remember seeing a fact somewhere that Paris has around 12 million people. But wait, is that the metropolitan area or the city proper?\\n\\nHmm, I\\'m a bit confused between the city limits and the metropolitan area. I think the metropolitan area includes surrounding suburbs and that number might be higher. Maybe around 21 million? I\\'m not entirely certain, but I\\'ve seen figures quoted around that range. I should probably double-check that.\\n\\nAlso, I wonder if the population has changed over the years. Populations can fluctuate due to births, deaths, and migration. I think it\\'s important to note if the figure I\\'m recalling is current. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I guess I should provide the most recent estimate. However, I\\'m not sure when that data was last updated.\\n\\nWait, am I mixing up the figures for Paris with other major cities in France? For example, I know Lyon is a significant city too, but its population is much smaller. Maybe 1 million something. No, that\\'s probably not right. I think I might be mixing numbers for different cities.\\n\\nLet me think of it another way. I know that France\\'s total population is around 40 million. If Paris has 12 million, that leaves the rest of the country with about 28 million, which seems plausible. But I\\'m still not entirely sure about the exact figure for Paris.\\n\\nI should also consider the source of the information. Is this a recent statistic from a government source? I believe the National Institute of Statistics and registrar of births, deaths, and marriages in France (Insee) is a reliable source. They probably have the most accurate data. So, if Insee states that the population is approximately 12 million for Paris, that\\'s the number to go with.\\n\\nWait, but earlier I thought the metropolitan area might be around 21 million. Maybe the user is asking specifically for the city proper, not the metropolitan area. That\\'s important because sometimes people refer to different levels of administrative division. If the user is interested in the city limits, then 12 million is correct. If they mean the broader metropolitan area, then 21 million is more accurate.\\n\\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps it\\'s best to clarify whether the population refers to the city proper or the metropolitan area. Since the user just asked for the capital\\'s population without specifying, I should assume they want the city proper. So, 12 million would be the correct figure.\\n\\nIn summary, after considering possible sources and clarifying whether it\\'s the city or metropolitan area, I believe the population of Paris is approximately 12 million. I should present this information clearly in JSON format as the user requested.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 12000000\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'c6807c18eacb44b08f02bdbbb7dc9350', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 692, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 10.968832731246948}}</strong>"
