    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Alright, let me figure out how to help the user with their request. They're in New York and want the current date and time along with the weather. I remember that there's a function called get_current_date and another called get_current_weather that can help with this.<br><br>First, I need to determine which function to use for the date and time. The get_current_date function requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I should provide the timezone as 'America/New_York'. That way, the function will fetch the correct current date and time for that location.<br><br>Next, for the weather information, I need to use the get_current_weather function. This function needs the city, state, and unit as parameters. The user mentioned they're in New York, so the city is 'New York', the state is 'NY', and they probably want the temperature in Fahrenheit since that's a common unit for many users. So, I'll set unit to 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>I should make sure to structure the function calls correctly. Each function call should be on its own line, using the specified format with start_tag, parameters in JSON, and end_tag. I'll call get_current_date first with the timezone parameter, then get_current_weather with the city, state, and unit parameters.<br><br>I also need to remember to include the sources in the response. For the date and time, the documentation is the source, and for the weather, it's the Weather API documentation.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write two separate function calls. The first one will get the date and time for 'America/New_York', and the second will fetch the weather details for 'New York' in Fahrenheit.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '74fb3787b4c541baae195ce0ba7cd248', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.834055662155151}}</strong>"

I should make sure to cover both.\\n\\nI know that Paris is the largest city in France and one of the most important in the world. I should include some key facts. Maybe the population figure, but I remember it\\'s a big city with a concentrated population. In 2021, I think it was around 2.2 million. I should double-check that. Oh, actually, I think the latest data is as of 2023, putting it at about 2.2 million.\\n\\nAlso, Paris has a rich cultural history. I should mention some of its landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and the Arc de Triomphe. Including cultural significance and one of its official French names, \"La République\" which translates to The People\\'s Republic, would add depth.\\n\\nSince they asked for JSON format, I\\'ll structure it with \"name\" as \"Paris\", \"population\" as the number, and \"description\" with the detailed info. I need to present it neatly, maybe with each key on a new line for clarity.\\n\\nI should be careful to present this information accurately. Even though it\\'s a well-known city, I don\\'t want to mix up any data. Maybe include a note at the end about the population figure being an approximation, just in case it changes. That way, the user knows the data is current and reliable.\\n\\nAlright, putting it all together, the JSON should be straightforward.
