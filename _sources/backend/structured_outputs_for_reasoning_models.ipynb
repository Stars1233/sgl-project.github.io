    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

Okay, I feel confident about that. I'll just state it directly.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. \\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I\\'ll stick to that. \\n\\nLastly, I\\'ll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. <br><br>Next, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

First, I should recall where the capital of France is. From what I remember, the capital is Paris. I think that\\'s correct, but I should make sure. Looking it up now, yes, Paris is indeed the capital of France.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the current population of Paris. Population numbers can change over time due to various factors like birth rates, death rates, and migration. I know that major cities can have fluctuating populations. I\\'ll do a quick check online. According to recent data, Paris has a population around 2,198,200 as of 2023. It\\'s important to note that this number might have changed slightly since then, so I\\'ll keep it as an approximation unless I can find a more precise current figure.\\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into the JSON format. JSON requires a specific syntax with keys and values. So, I\\'ll create an object where the key is \"capital\" and the value is \"Paris\". Then, I\\'ll add another key, maybe \"population\", with the associated value of 2198200. It\\'s also good form to include the date of the population estimate as a string, so I\\'ll write that as \"2023-10-25\", assuming that\\'s when I retrieved the data.\\n\\nI should double-check the syntax to make sure there are commas and colons in the right places. Each key-value pair is separated by a comma, except for the last one. I\\'ll also ensure that the quotes around the keys and string values are correctly placed. The numbers shouldn\\'t have quotes unless they\\'re part of a string.\\n\\nWait, the population figure I found is approximately 2,198,200. Should I present it without commas or with commas? JSON doesn\\'t enforce formatting, so it\\'s the same whether you write it as 2198200 or 2,198,200. But for readability, it\\'s better to use the latter. However, if I\\'m following strict JSON standards, I should avoid commas in the number. Hmm, but JSON allows both; it\\'s more about structure than formatting. Since I\\'m not sure, I\\'ll write the number without commas, which is acceptable.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON like this:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2198200,\\n  \"date\": \"2023-10-25\"\\n}\\n\\nI should also consider if this information is up to date. Population figures can vary yearly, so it\\'s possible the population has changed since my reference date. For instance, if a year has passed, the population might have increased. But without more recent data, I\\'ll stick with the figure I have.\\n\\nI wonder if there are more accurate sources for the population. Maybe the official statistics from the French National Institute of Statistics and Management of the Graph.credit (INSEE) would provide the most up-to-date and accurate numbers. Checking that, yes, they do update their figures, but access might be restricted or require specific documentation. For my purposes here, the 2023 estimate seems reasonable.\\n\\nJust to be thorough, I\\'ll reconsider the structure. Each key in JSON should be in camelCase or PascalCase. \"Population\" is PascalCase, which is acceptable. \"Capital\" could be PascalCase as well, but it\\'s commonly used as \"capital\" in lowercase, following JSON conventions where strings are lowercase unless specified otherwise. The date format is also fine as a string in ISO 8601.\\n\\nI don\\'t think I need any additional keys unless more information is required. If I were to provide more data, I might add things like area, administration level, or GDP, but for now, the user only asked for information and population. So, keeping it simple is better.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the JSON object should accurately reflect the capital and population of Paris as of my latest reliable data source, structured correctly with appropriate syntax to ensure it\\'s a valid JSON format.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the JSON formatted information about the capital of France, structured with clarity and adhering to JSON standards:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2198200,\\n  \"date\": \"2023-10-25\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object includes the capital \"Paris,\" its estimated population of 2,198,200 as of October 25, 2023, and the date of the population estimate.', 'meta_info': {'id': 'a577e1564c60434d8ec4949f07d01982', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 978, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 9.327592372894287}}</strong>"

Maybe around 2 million? I think it's been growing over the years. \n",
