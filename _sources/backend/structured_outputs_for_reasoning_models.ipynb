    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking for the current date and time in New York and the weather there. I remember that I have two functions available: get_current_weather and get_current_date. <br><br>First, I need to get the weather. The get_current_weather function requires a city, state, and unit. The user mentioned New York, so the city is \"New York\". Since New York is in New York state, the state parameter is \"NY\". They didn't specify the unit, so I'll default to Fahrenheit because that's a common request, but I should check if the function allows that. <br><br>Wait, looking back, the function's parameters mention that 'unit' can be 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'. It's required, so I need to provide one. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I should include both options but in the response, I can just pick one. Alternatively, I can include both in the explanation. Hmm, but the user just wants the current weather, so I'll choose Fahrenheit as a default.<br><br>Next, for the date and time, I'll use the get_current_date function. The timezone parameter is \"America/New_York\". I need to make sure that's the correct string format. <br><br>I should structure this by calling each function separately. First, the get_current_weather with the parameters: city=\"New York\", state=\"NY\", unit=\"fahrenheit\". Then, get_current_date with timezone=\"America/New_York\". <br><br>I should also remember to format the responses correctly, using the start_tag and end_tag as specified. Each function call should be on a single line, and I should include the parameters within a JSON object.<br><br>Wait, the user said to put the entire function call reply on one line. So I can combine both function calls in one message, but each function call is separate. But the example response used two separate function calls. Maybe I should do the same, but the user's instruction was to include both in one thought. Hmm, perhaps I should format it as two separate function calls in the same message, each on their own line, but within the same message.<br><br>Wait, looking back, the user's initial message was a single line, so maybe I should structure it as two separate function calls in the same message, each on their own line. But the example response used a single function call. So maybe I should do each function call separately, but in the same message, each on their own line.<br><br>Wait, but the user's instruction says to put the entire function call reply on one line. So maybe I should combine them into one line, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can make two separate function calls in the same message.<br><br>But perhaps the best way is to structure each function call on its own line, but within the same message. So, in the response, I can have:<br><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}></function><br><function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}></function><br><br>That way, both function calls are included in the same message, each on their own line, and each properly formatted.<br><br>Wait, but the user's example had a single function call on one line. Maybe I should follow that format. So, if I have to combine both into one line, perhaps I can do:<br><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}></function><function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}></function><br><br>But that might look a bit messy, but it's possible. Alternatively, I can separate them with line breaks.<br><br>I think the best approach is to call each function separately, so each function call is on its own line within the same message. That way, the response is clear and each function is properly formatted.<br><br>So, I'll prepare the response with each function call on a separate line, each properly formatted with the parameters in JSON.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function><function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function></strong>"

First, I\\'ll identify who the capital is. From what I remember, the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty straightforward. \\n\\nNow, I need to get the population. I\\'m not entirely up to date, but I think Paris has a pretty sizable population. I believe it\\'s around 2 million people. But to be precise, I should probably double-check that. Let me think... Yes, I recall it\\'s approximately 2,170,000. That seems about right, but I might be remembering inaccurately, so I should verify.\\n\\nWait, but do I have the latest data? Population can change every year due to births, deaths, and migration. Maybe it\\'s slightly higher or lower this year. However, I don\\'t have real-time access, so I\\'ll stick with my best estimate. I just want to make sure it\\'s around that area. Alright, 2,170,000 seems accurate enough for now.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, I\\'ll structure it in JSON format. The key points are the name of the city, population, and maybe its administrative division. Paris is in the Île-de-France region, which is a major part of the country. Including that might be helpful. \\n\\nI should make sure the JSON is properly formatted. The keys should be strings and the population should be a number. That\\'s standard for JSON. Also, I\\'ll keep it simple with just the city name, population, and region, unless the user asks for more.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I\\'ll respond by stating that the capital of France is Paris, its estimated population is about 2.17 million, and it\\'s located in Île-de-France, France.\\n</think>\\n\\nCertainly! Here is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2170000,\\n    \"region\": \"Île-de-France, France\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '6e0fced8816944aa90c1681f0c531345', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 449, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.307416915893555}}</strong>"
