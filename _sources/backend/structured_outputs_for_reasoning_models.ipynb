    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

Both are available, so I can use them together.<br><br>Starting with the date. The function 'get_current_date' requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I should pass 'America/New_York' as the timezone. That way, I'll get the exact date and time relevant to their location.<br><br>Next, the weather. The function 'get_current_weather' needs city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state would be 'NY' because that's the two-letter abbreviation, and the unit should be 'fahrenheit' since that's a common preference, but I should note that it can be changed if needed.<br><br>I should structure the response by first calling 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter. Then, I'll call 'get_current_weather' with the required parameters. I need to make sure each function call is on a separate line and includes the parameters in JSON format within the function tags.<br><br>Wait, the user also mentioned to always add sources when using search results. Since I'm using built-in functions, I don't need external data, so I'll just state that the data is provided by the functions without citing a specific source.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll format each function call correctly, ensuring that the parameters are accurately specified.

JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

Hmm, let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out who this user is. They\\'re asking for a structured response, so they might be programming or doing a project that requires JSON data. Possibly a web application or an API integration?\\n\\nThe user specifically asked for the capital\\'s information and population. The capital of France is Paris, so that\\'s straightforward. They probably want this in a format that\\'s easy to parse and use in their code. JSON is perfect for that because it\\'s a common data format and easy to handle.\\n\\nNow, about the population. I should get the latest data. From what I know, the population of Paris is around 2.1 million, but I should verify the exact figure. I\\'m not certain off the top of my head, so I should look up the current estimate. Wait, let me think—actual numbers: as of 2023, Paris has a population of approximately 2,155,000. That seems about right.\\n\\nSo, the user is probably looking for something precise. Maybe they\\'re building an app and need accurate stats. They might also need other details like area, başka มกร +% urbanization or something related. I should make sure to include that for thoroughness.\\n\\nOkay, putting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with the main info like name, population, area, and urbanization. That should cover what they need. I\\'ll make sure the data is up-to-date and accurate. If they need more details, they can ask, so it\\'s better to provide a solid foundation now.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2155000,  // As of the latest estimate (2023)\\n    \"area\": 105.5,\\n    \"urbanization\": \"Very urban\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object contains the following details about Paris:\\n- Name of the capital city: Paris\\n- Population estimate (as of 2023): 2,155,000\\n- Area (in square kilometers): 105.5\\n- Urbanization status: \"Very urban\"', 'meta_info': {'id': '71d9908ed3f24b3dbaefd27c1da63d3f', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 504, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.678012847900391}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let's see. First, I need to figure out where the capital is. I know that Paris is the capital of France, so that's the location.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so it's definitely a large urban area. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact number. I think it's around 2 million people, but maybe a bit more? Wait, I think the population is around 2,170,000 as of recent estimates. I should double-check that to be accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "They specified JSON format, so I need to structure it correctly. JSON requires keys and values, probably something like \"capital\": \"Paris\" and \"population\": 2170000. That seems straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there are any other details they might need, like the country it's in or the area. But the user specifically asked for the capital and population, so maybe those two are sufficient. Including more details could be helpful, but it's probably better to stick to what they asked for unless they mention needing more information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user's query was in French. I should make sure the JSON key is in English, right? Or should it be in French? Hmm, they might expect the keys in English since that's more standard for JSON. But I'm not entirely sure. I'll stick with English for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, is the population figure up to date? I'm using the latest estimate I have, which I think is accurate. If the user needs the most current data, they can look it up themselves. \n",
