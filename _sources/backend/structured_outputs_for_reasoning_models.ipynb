    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",
    "- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to generate information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I should recall what Paris is known for. It's the main city in France, right? I know it's a major cultural, economic, and political center. <br><br>I should probably start by listing the basic facts. Paris is the capital, so I'll note that. Then, I remember it's located in the northern part of the country, in the Île-de-France region. The coordinates are something like 48°51′N 2°28′E, but I'm not sure about the exact minutes and seconds. Maybe I should look that up, but since I'm just brainstorming, I'll approximate it.<br><br>Next, Paris is famous for landmarks. The Eiffel Tower is a must. The Louvre Museum is another major attraction. The Arc de Triomphe and Notre-Dame come to mind too. I should include those. Also, the city is known for its cuisine, like baguettes and croissants, and its fashion scene, which is quite influential.<br><br>I should think about Paris's history. It's been a political and cultural hub for centuries. It's the birthplace of many famous people, like Charlie de Gaulle and Victor Hugo. The Paris Agreement is another important fact, as it's related to climate change.<br><br>Economically, Paris is a significant center. It's home to major companies and financial institutions. The Île-de-France region is part of theGreater Paris metropolitan area, which is quite large.<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has an extensive public transit system, including the Métro, which is a large subway network. The Château de Invalides is a notable landmark with the statue of the Last Knight of the French Revolution.<br><br>I should also mention the Paris Agreement, which was signed in 2015. It's about reducing greenhouse gas emissions. That's an important environmental fact.<br><br>Now, putting this all together into a JSON structure. I'll start with a \"name\" field as \"Paris, France\". Then, an \"overview\" that summarizes its significance. The \"facts\" array will contain key points like being the capital, location, landmarks, cuisine, history, economy, transportation, and the Paris Agreement.<br><br>I need to make sure each fact is a string, so I'll just list them as strings without any special formatting. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it simple. Let me check if I missed anything. Maybe the population? But since it's a city, it's over a million, but perhaps that's too detailed for a basic JSON. I'll stick to the main points.<br><br>Wait, I should also include the coordinates more accurately. I think the Eiffel Tower is at 48.8584°N 2.2945°E, but I'm not entirely sure. I might need to double-check that. Also, the Arc de Triomphe is near the Eiffel Tower, so that's correct.<br><br>I think that's a solid list. Now, I'll structure it into JSON, making sure each key is in quotes and the values are strings. I'll separate each fact with a comma. Let me make sure there are no trailing commas to keep it valid JSON.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 120000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the information about the capital of France and present it in JSON format. Let me start by recalling what I know about Paris. I know it's the capital, but I should probably double-check that. Yeah, I'm pretty sure Paris is the administrative capital, but sometimes people might confuse it with other cities like Lyon or Marseille. But no, Paris is definitely the official capital.<br><br>Now, moving on to the population. I think Paris is a very large city, one of the biggest in the world. I remember reading somewhere that it's over 3 million people, but I'm not sure of the exact figure. Maybe around 3.5 million? I should look that up to be accurate, but since I'm just brainstorming, I'll go with that estimate.<br><br>Next, the area. Paris is a big city, but it's also a dense urban area. I think the metropolitan area covers a large region, maybe around 12,000 square kilometers? But the city proper is smaller. I'm not exactly sure, but I'll put 10,500 square kilometers for the city area and 12,000 for the metropolitan area.<br><br>Language is another point. Paris is a center for French culture, so the predominant language there is definitely French. I don't think they speak any other language there predominantly, though there might be some English, especially in tourist areas or with expatriates.<br><br>Cuisine is interesting. Paris is known for its high-end, fine dining, especially French cuisine. I know places like Le Faitout and others that are famous for their intricate dishes. Parisians are also known for their coffee culture, so maybe that's another point to include.<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has an extensive public transit system. The RER and地铁 are part of the BTP, which I think stands for Bahn, Tram, and Metro in German, but in French, it's the same. The city is well-connected by train, with major stations like Gare du Nord and Châtelet. The Eiffel Tower is a major landmark, and it's accessible by train from Paris.<br><br>I should also mention some of the main attractions. The Eiffel Tower is iconic, along with the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. These are must-see spots for tourists.<br><br>Now, putting this all together into JSON format. I'll structure it with an \"info\" key that contains a \"capital\" object with \"name,\" \"population,\" \"area,\" and \"language.\" Then, an \"attractions\" array that lists the main points of interest. I'll make sure the numbers are approximate since I don't have exact figures on hand.<br><br>Wait, I should check if the population is over 3 million or 3.5. I think it's around 3.5 million as of recent estimates. The area, I'm pretty sure the metropolitan area is about 12,000 km², and the city proper is a bit less, maybe 10,500 km². That seems right.<br><br>So, the JSON structure would have the info object with the necessary details, and the attractions array listing the main landmarks.

I need to figure out how to get both pieces of information using the allowed functions.<br><br>First, I'll check which functions are available. There's 'get_current_weather' and 'get_current_date'. I need to use both since the user asked for both the date/time and the weather.<br><br>For the current date and time, I should use 'get_current_date'. The function requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I'll set the timezone to 'America/New_York'. That should give me the exact time they're asking for.<br><br>Next, the weather. I'll use 'get_current_weather' which needs city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state would be 'NY' because New York's state abbreviation is NY. The unit should be 'fahrenheit' since the default in the example was Fahrenheit. <br><br>I need to make sure both function calls are properly formatted. Each function call should be on its own line, with the function name and parameters in the specified JSON format. I'll structure them separately so the user can see each result clearly.<br><br>I should also remember to include the sources where I got the information from, but since I'm using predefined functions, I don't need to add any additional sources beyond what's provided.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write two separate function calls: one for the date and time, and another for the weather. Each will have the correct parameters as per the function descriptions.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

      "{'text': 'Okay, so I need to provide the information about the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, I\\'m not entirely sure about all the details, but I\\'ll try to think it through.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty much a given, right? But I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall any other capitals I know. London is the capital of the UK, Rome is Italy, and maybe Tokyo is Japan\\'s. Yeah, Paris seems correct for France.\\n\\nNow, moving on to the population. I think Paris is a very large city, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I remember it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not certain. Maybe around 3.5 million? I should probably look that up, but since I can\\'t right now, I\\'ll go with 3,500,000 as an estimate.\\n\\nNext, the area. Paris is a big city, but I think it\\'s not as large as Tokyo or London. Maybe around 10 square kilometers? I\\'m not sure, but that seems plausible. I\\'ll note that as 10,000,000 square meters.\\n\\nCoordinates are next. Paris is in France, so the country code is \"FR\". The latitude and longitude... I think the approximate coordinates are around 48.8566° N latitude and 2.3522° E longitude. I remember that Paris is in the northern and eastern parts of France, so those should be correct.\\n\\nOfficial languages. France is a country with a lot of languages, but I think French is the official language. I\\'m not sure if they have others, but French is definitely the primary one. Maybe they also have some other languages spoken there, but I\\'ll stick with French for now.\\n\\nOfficial currency is the euro, right? Yeah, I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s correct. They use the euro as their main currency.\\n\\nI should also consider if there\\'s anything else I might need to include. Maybe the capital\\'s nickname? I think Paris is called the \"City of Light\" or something like that. But the user didn\\'t ask for that, so maybe it\\'s not necessary.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with the key-value pairs. The keys should be in English, and the values can be numbers, strings, or maybe even objects if needed. Since the population and area are numerical, I\\'ll represent them as numbers. The rest can be strings.\\n\\nWait, but in JSON, numbers don\\'t have commas, right? So 3,500,000 should be written as 3500000 without the comma. Same with the area, 10,000,000 square meters becomes 10000000.\\n\\nLet me make sure I\\'m formatting the JSON correctly. The keys should be in double quotes, and the values can be numbers or strings. So the structure would be something like:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"area\": 10000000,\\n  \"country\": \"FR\",\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n  },\\n  \"languages\": \"French\",\\n  \"currency\": \"Euro\"\\n}\\n\\nWait, but the coordinates are just two numbers, so maybe I don\\'t need a nested object. So it would be:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"area\": 10000000,\\n  \"country\": \"FR\",\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n  },\\n  \"languages\": \"French\",\\n  \"currency\": \"Euro\"\\n}\\n\\nThat looks better. I think that\\'s all the information I need. I should make sure that the numerical values don\\'t have commas and that the strings are in double quotes. Also, the keys should be in lowercase letters as per JSON standards.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve covered everything. Population and area are estimates, but they\\'re close enough for a general JSON format. I don\\'t think I need to include more details unless specified. So, this should be the correct JSON structure for the information about the capital of France.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000', 'meta_info': {'id': 'd8b9a83e521d4db380556b3dbb7c4f40', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'length', 'length': 2048}, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 2048, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 21.198166847229004}}\n"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the derivative of a function, right? Let me see. The function is f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5. I remember from class that to find the derivative, I need to use the power rule. \\n\\nAlright, the power rule says that if I have a function like x^n, its derivative is n*x^(n-1). So, applying that to each term of the function should give me the derivative. Let\\'s break it down term by term.\\n\\nFirst term: 3x^2. The exponent is 2, so I bring that down as a coefficient, multiply it by 3, which gives me 6. Then, I reduce the exponent by 1, so it becomes x^(2-1) = x^1, which is just x. So, the derivative of 3x^2 is 6x.\\n\\nSecond term: 2x. The exponent here is 1 because x is the same as x^1. Applying the power rule, I bring down the 1 as a coefficient, multiply it by 2, which gives me 2. Then, reduce the exponent by 1, so it becomes x^(1-1) = x^0, which is 1. So, the derivative of 2x is 2.\\n\\nThird term: -5. This is a constant term. I remember that the derivative of a constant is zero because there\\'s no change as x changes. So, the derivative of -5 is 0.\\n\\nNow, putting it all together, the derivative of f(x) should be 6x + 2. Wait, let me double-check. The first term\\'s derivative is 6x, the second is 2, and the third is 0. So, yes, adding them up gives 6x + 2.\\n\\nI think that\\'s it. But just to be sure, maybe I should plug in a value for x and see if the derivative makes sense. Let\\'s say x = 1. The original function f(1) = 3(1)^2 + 2(1) - 5 = 3 + 2 - 5 = 0. The derivative at x=1 is 6(1) + 2 = 8. So, at the point (1,0), the slope of the tangent line should be 8. That seems reasonable.\\n\\nAnother check: x = 0. f(0) = 3(0)^2 + 2(0) -5 = -5. The derivative at x=0 is 6(0) + 2 = 2. So, the slope at (0,-5) is 2. That also makes sense because the function is a parabola opening upwards, so the slope at the vertex (which is at x = -b/(2a) = -2/(6) = -1/3) should be zero. Wait, but at x=0, it\\'s 2. Hmm, maybe I should calculate the slope at x = -1/3. Let\\'s see, f\\'(-1/3) = 6*(-1/3) + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0. Yes, that\\'s correct. So, the derivative at x=0 is 2, which is positive, meaning the function is increasing there, which aligns with the parabola\\'s shape.\\n\\nI think I\\'m confident now. The derivative is 6x + 2.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"StepbyStepSolution\",\\n\"population\": 1000000000\\n\\n\\n  \\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n \\t\\t}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'b0fa6f9dc0664d7c8ec7480d85236633', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 5, 'completion_tokens': 790, 'cached_tokens': 2, 'e2e_latency': 7.739607572555542}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I need to figure out the capital of France using the information provided in the JSON format. Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I see the JSON object has a key called \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\". That\\'s straightforward. But I should make sure I understand the structure correctly. The main key here is \"capital\", and the value associated with it is the name of the city. So, it seems like the capital is explicitly stated in the JSON.\\n\\nI want to confirm if this is correct. I remember from my geography classes that Paris is indeed the capital of France. It\\'s the largest city and the political center. So the JSON seems accurate here.\\n\\nI might wonder if there\\'s any additional information in the JSON that could provide more context. Looking through the JSON, I see fields like \"official_name\", \"coordinates\", \"population\", etc. But for this specific question, those aren\\'t necessary. The key \"capital\" directly gives the answer.\\n\\nI can also think about the format of the JSON. It\\'s a common data format used for transmitting data in a machine-readable format. The structure here is simple, with keys in double quotes and string values also in double quotes. The value for \"capital\" is just \"Paris\", without any commas or additional information, which avoids any ambiguity.\\n\\nMaybe I can test this JSON in a small program to verify. If I write a simple script to read the JSON, it should output \"Paris\" when asked for the capital. Alternatively, if I open the JSON in a browser as JSON data, it should display the information correctly, showing \"capital\": \"Paris\".\\n\\nI should also consider if there\\'s any possibility of multiple capital names being listed, but in this case, the JSON only has one value, which is Paris. So, there\\'s no ambiguity here. It\\'s straightforward.\\n\\nI might check if the JSON object is valid. Using a JSON validator, I can see if the structure is correct. The key is correctly named, and the value is properly formatted as a string. No syntax errors, so it\\'s a valid JSON object.\\n\\nFurthermore, thinking about data types, the value is a string, which is appropriate for storing a city name. If it were a number or another data type, that would cause confusion, but in this case, it\\'s correctly handled.\\n\\nI can also reflect on the purpose of this JSON. It could be part of a larger dataset, such as a list of countries with their capitals, or it might be a standalone piece of information. Regardless, extracting the capital from this JSON is direct and efficient.\\n\\nIn summary, the JSON provides the necessary information clearly and concisely. The key \"capital\" has the value \"Paris\", which is the correct answer to the question.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is \"Paris\", as explicitly stated in the provided JSON.', 'meta_info': {'id': '01bf09de386a42379219a0931ebd404c', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 584, 'cached_tokens': 19, 'e2e_latency': 6.305129289627075}}</strong>"
