    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

The user mentioned using specific functions, so I should probably use the ones they provided: get_current_weather and get_current_date.<br><br>First, I need the current date and time for New York's timezone. The get_current_date function requires a timezone parameter. New York is in the Eastern Time Zone, often abbreviated as EST, but more accurately it's Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) in summer and Eastern Standard Time (EST) in winter. However, for the most accurate result, I should use the full timezone name, which is 'America/New_York'. So I'll call get_current_date with timezone set to 'America/New_York'.<br><br>Next, for the weather. The get_current_weather function needs the city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state is NY, and I'll choose Fahrenheit since the user didn't specify. So the parameters will be city: 'New York', state: 'NY', unit: 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>I should make sure to include both function calls in the response, each on its own line with the correct syntax. Also, I need to format the JSON parameters correctly within each function call. Let me double-check the required parameters for each function to ensure I'm providing all necessary information.<br><br>Wait, the user mentioned putting the entire function call on one line, so I should structure each function call without any line breaks. That means each function will be a single line with the function name, an equals sign, and a JSON object in curly braces.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll list the two function calls one after the other, each properly formatted with their respective parameters. That should cover everything the user asked for.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{  <br>  \"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"  <br>}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. \\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I\\'ll stick to that. \\n\\nLastly, I\\'ll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. <br><br>Next, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I need to figure out who the user is and why they\\'re asking this. They might be a student working on a project, or maybe they\\'re just curious. Regardless, they\\'re looking for a straightforward data point in a structured format.\\n\\nI know the capital of France is Paris. Now, I should recall or look up the current population. I\\'m pretty sure Paris has a population over 3 million, but I should check the exact number to make sure. Let me think... I believe it\\'s around 3,500,000 as of the latest estimates. It\\'s important to have an accurate figure, so I should double-check that. But considering I can\\'t access the internet, I\\'ll go with the commonly accepted figure.\\n\\nNext, I need to format this information into JSON. JSON requires keys and values, so I\\'ll structure it with \"City\" as the key and include the population under a subkey like \"population\". I should present it clearly, maybe breaking it into two lines for readability. \\n\\nI wonder, is there a reason they want it in JSON format? Maybe they\\'re integrating this data into an application or a website. Ensuring the format is correct is crucial for their purpose. I\\'ll make sure the commas and brackets are in the right place to avoid any parsing issues.\\n\\nAlso, I should consider why they specifically asked for JSON. They might be familiar with it, so providing the data without any extra fluff would be best. I don\\'t need to add explanations or anything else unless they ask for it later.\\n\\nI should also think about any potential mistakes I might make. Like, spelling the city name correctly and ensuring the population number is up to date. Since I\\'m not entirely sure about the exact current population, being accurate is key. Maybe I can mention that the population figure is approximate to indicate that it\\'s an estimate and could change over time.\\n\\nAnother thought: Maybe the user wants just the population of Paris without the city name. But the query says \"the information and population\", so including both is appropriate. Alternatively, if they only need the population, I can just provide that, but I\\'ll stick to the query\\'s wording.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I should present the population in a more readable format, like 3.5 million instead of 3500000. That\\'s a common practice for better readability. So I\\'ll format it with commas, like 3,500,000.\\n\\nI think that\\'s it. I\\'ll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring it\\'s correctly formatted with proper syntax. No markdown, just plain JSON. And I\\'ll make sure there are no typos or formatting errors that could cause issues when they use it.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"City\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Population\": \"3,500,000 (approximate)\"\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'dbe55c7fb0174d9ba6bc133527bcafe7', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 623, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.817668437957764}}</strong>"

I know Paris is the capital, but let me double-check to make sure I'm accurate. Yep, Paris is definitely the capital city of France.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, now they want the population. I remember that France has a pretty large population, around 33 million, but I should verify the exact figure. I think the population is in the mid-30s. Maybe 33.9 million? I'll go with that because it's a commonly cited number and it's from recent estimates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user also asked for the population of the capital, not the whole country. So I need to make sure I provide the population for Paris specifically. I recall that Paris is the most populous city in France, so it should be higher than the national average. I think it's around 2.2 million. Let me check that number again. Yeah, that sounds right. I think it's approximately 2,198,000 people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, putting it into JSON format. JSON uses key-value pairs, so I'll structure it with \"city\" as the key and \"population\" as another key. The value for population should be the number I came up with. I should also make sure to use proper syntax, with quotation marks and commas in the right places.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include units? The user didn't specify, but including 'approx.' makes it clear that it's an estimate. So I'll add that note. I don't need to explain the units since population is usually in thousands or millions, but it's good to be clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the user's intent. They might be doing a quick fact check or a data extraction for another purpose. So providing accurate and concise information is key. They didn't mention needing a detailed breakdown, just the data in JSON. So keeping it straightforward is best.\n",
      "\n",
