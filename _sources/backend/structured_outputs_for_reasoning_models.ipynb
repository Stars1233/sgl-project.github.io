    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see... Yes, according to the latest data, the population is approximately 2,174,300 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \"country\". The city is Paris, the population is the number I found, and the country is France.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. The entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. I\\'ll format it properly to avoid any syntax errors.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have the city, population, and country. I\\'ll present this to the user, making sure it\\'s clear and easy to understand. I don\\'t think the user needs anything more detailed, so this should suffice.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need additional information, like the area or age distribution, but since they only asked for population, I\\'ll stick to that. Maybe they\\'ll ask for more details later, but for now, this response should be helpful.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '8874716db75247ef8182cde7f19104d6', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 384, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.431464433670044}}</strong>"

First off, I should make sure I know which country\\'s capital I\\'m talking about. The user said \"capital of France,\" so I\\'m dealing with Paris.\\n\\nI\\'m a bit fuzzy on the exact population numbers, but I remember it\\'s a big city, so the population must be in the millions. I think it\\'s around 20-something million. Let me try to recall any recent data points. I believe in 2020, Paris had a population estimate of about 21 million. \\n\\nBut wait, population numbers can change. I should check if there\\'s been any recent growth or perhaps a decrease. I remember reading somewhere that major cities in developed countries often have fluctuating populations due to factors like birth rates, immigration, and people moving away for work. \\n\\nParis as an expensivetraveler destination might attract more immigrants, but also, the high cost of living could make some people move out. So, it\\'s possible the population is rising but at a slower rate than previous decades. \\n\\nI think the most recent official estimate would be the most accurate. The National Institute of Statistics andlemetry (Insee) in France probably has the most up-to-date figures. If I recall correctly, as of 2023, Paris\\' population is approximately 21.5 to 22 million people. \\n\\nFor the JSON format, I need to structure it properly. The user provided an example, so I\\'ll follow that. They included the \"name\" as \"Paris\" and \"population\" as 21500000. So, in my case, I\\'ll use either 21500000 or round it to 21600000 if 21.5 million is closer, but maybe 21500000 sounds more precise based on the latest data.\\n\\nWait, I should double-check if that\\'s accurate. Let me think, 21 million is 21,000,000 and 21.5 is 21,500,000. So, using 21500000 in the JSON would represent 21.5 million, which aligns with what I remembered.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON object with \"name\" as \"Paris\" and \"population\" as 21500000. That should meet the user\\'s requirement effectively.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 21500000\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'bea585451ccc46d2b6d6ffb871b0e7ea', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 561, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.416786193847656}}</strong>"
