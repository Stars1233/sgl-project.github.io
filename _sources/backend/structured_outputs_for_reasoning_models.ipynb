    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

I know that Paris is the capital of France, but I should double-check to make sure. Yeah, Paris is definitely the capital.\\n\\nNext, the user wants this info in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it\\'s a way to structure data. They specifically mentioned population, so I need to provide both the city name and the population number. I remember reading that the population of Paris is over 2 million. Let me think, it\\'s around 2,158,000 in 2021. I should verify the exact figure to be accurate.\\n\\nWait, is the population of Paris the same as the population of France? No, France\\'s population is much larger, around 40 million. But the user specifically asked for the capital, so I should focus on Paris. I don\\'t want to mix up Paris\\'s population with the country\\'s total. \\n\\nAlso, maybe the user is a student doing a project or a researcher. They might need this data for quick reference in a structured format. So providing it in JSON is useful for them because it\\'s easy to parse and use in other applications.\\n\\nI should structure the JSON with keys for \"city\" and \"population\". Using the correct JSON syntax with commas and quotes is important to avoid any errors. I need to make sure there are no trailing commas since that could mess up the structure. \\n\\nWait, if I put a comma after \"capital\", that would be wrong in JSON. So the response should just be the city name followed by the population number without any extra commas. \\n\\nI also wonder if the user wants the population number as a number or a string. JSON prefers numbers without quotes, so I\\'ll leave the population as a number. That way, if they use this JSON elsewhere, it can be parsed correctly without quotes.\\n\\nLet me put it all together. The JSON should have a key called \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key called \"population\" with the value 2158000. That\\'s accurate as of 2021 data. If the user needs the most recent data, they might have to check an updated source, but for now, this should suffice.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve covered all the points. The user asked for the capital and population in JSON, so I\\'ve provided that clearly and accurately. Hopefully, this meets their needs and any potential follow-up questions.\\n</think>\\n\\nSure! Here’s the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2158000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object contains the name of the capital (\"Paris\") and its population (as of 2021 estimates).', 'meta_info': {'id': '36b51566ed604d2394b459c49c3fd36e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 594, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.458259582519531}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to find out the information and population of the capital of France. First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty much a given, but I should double-check to make sure I'm not mistaken. Maybe I can recall from history or some basic facts I've learned. Yeah, Paris is definitely the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, for the population. I'm not exactly sure of the current number, but I remember it's a big city with a lot of people. I think it's in the millions. Maybe around 3 million? I'm not certain. I should think about any recent events or news that might have updated the population numbers. I don't recall any major events that would drastically change the population, so perhaps it's still around that range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I can think about other cities in France and their populations to get a sense. For example, I know Lyon has about 1 million people, and Marseille is around 1.5 million. So Paris being the largest makes sense. I think it's somewhere between 3 and 3.2 million. I've heard that the population is growing, so maybe it's a bit higher than 3 million now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also remember that Paris has a lot of subdivisions, like arrondissements, which are like neighborhoods. There are 20 of them, each with varying populations. So the overall city is spread out, but the metro area is even bigger. The metro area population might be in the tens of millions, but the city proper might be around 3 million. I think the city proper population is the figure that's usually reported for the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be precise, I think the population figure is approximately 3,500,000 people. That sounds right. I don't have exact data here, but based on what I remember and the subdivisions, that number seems plausible. It's also a round number, which makes it easier to remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together, the JSON format should include the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the value 3500000. That should cover the information requested.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there are any alternative ways to present this information. Maybe including the metro area population if needed, but since the user asked for the capital's population, sticking to the city proper is better.\n",
