    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

The user provided some functions, so I need to use those properly. First, I think about the two functions they mentioned: 'get_current_weather' and 'get_current_date'.<br><br>I know that to get the weather, I need to provide the city, state, and unit. The city here is New York. I'm not sure about the state abbreviation. I think New York is NY, so state would be 'NY'. The unit should be either Celsius or Fahrenheit. Since the user didn't specify, I'll assume Fahrenheit since it's more common in the US.<br><br>Next, for the date and time, I need to call 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter. The timezone for New York is probably 'America/New_York'. I should make sure to format the parameters correctly as a JSON object.<br><br>I should structure the message by first calling 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter and then immediately follow up with 'get_current_weather' using the city, state, and unit. I need to make sure I use the correct syntax for the function calls, with the function name, followed by the parameters in JSON format within curly braces.<br><br>I also need to remember to add the sources where I got the information from, even if it's just a thought process. Since I'm using the functions as provided, I'll cite them at the end.<br><br>So putting it all together, I'll send two function calls in sequence. The first for the date and time, then the second for the weather. I have to make sure each function call is on its own line and properly formatted as per the instructions.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function><br><br>Sources:<br>- get_current_date function documentation<br>- get_current_weather function documentation</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. \\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I\\'ll stick to that. \\n\\nLastly, I\\'ll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '938e49ef7527429a87a74e526aaf802a', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 412, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 4.2455525398254395}}\n"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. <br><br>Next, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s a given, so the user should have that knowledge. Now, the request is specifically about the population. I need to provide accurate data for that.\\n\\nI should check the latest available data because populations can change. I remember that recent estimates have been around 9 million people, but I\\'m not exactly sure if that\\'s the exact number. I think it\\'s an approximate figure since exact population counts might vary due to factors like mover statistics.\\n\\nLooking into it, as of the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 9,350,000. But the user is probably looking for a more rounded figure rather than an exact number. So maybe 9 million is sufficient here.\\n\\nNow, structuring this in JSON format. I\\'ll need to define an object with a \"name\" key for the city, \"population\" for the number, and maybe a \"description\" to provide a bit more context. Since the population is an estimate, stating it clearly as such is important to avoid giving false information.\\n\\nI should also make sure that the JSON is properly formatted with key quotation marks and commas in the right places to prevent syntax errors. It\\'s crucial for the data to be correct, especially in JSON where typos can cause issues in applications that process the data.\\n\\nAdditionally, considering the use case, the user might be compiling this information into a report or a presentation and wants it to be clear and organized. So, providing the key information in a structured JSON format should meet their needs effectively.\\n\\nMaybe I should also note that population figures can vary and depend on the source, just in case the user needs more detailed information. But since the user specifically asked for the JSON format with the population, I\\'ll focus on that.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with the necessary keys and ensure that the population figure is correctly listed. That way, the user gets a concise and accurate response in the format they requested.\\n</think>\\n\\nSure! Here\\'s the information in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": \"9,000,000\",\\n  \"description\": \"Approximate population of the city of Paris\"\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '3c36ea8e4ea147caabf13d557989ee6e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 501, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.8632965087890625}}</strong>"
