    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I remember it's over 3 million, but I'm not certain if it's 3.5 or 3.6. I should double-check that.<br><br>Next, I thought about the structure. The user wants JSON, so I need to format it correctly with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\". I should make sure the syntax is correct—no typos, proper commas, and brackets. <br><br>I also considered the user's possible needs. They might be doing a project or a presentation, so providing accurate data is crucial. Maybe they're a student learning about France's capitals or someone compiling demographic data. Either way, precision is key.<br><br>I decided to present the information clearly, ensuring the JSON is valid and easy to read. I included the population as 3.617 million, which I believe is the most recent figure I could recall.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

I should make sure I provide a clear and accurate answer. Let me think, Paris is definitely the capital. But wait, is there any chance I might have mixed it up with another country? No, I'm pretty sure France's capital is Paris. Maybe I should double-check that to be certain. Yeah, Paris is where the government is located, and that's the capital.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. \\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I\\'ll stick to that. \\n\\nLastly, I\\'ll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'a5cb929309ae4bb38d5402d59e9b964e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 412, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 4.126136064529419}}\n"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. <br><br>Next, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

First off, I need to identify what exactly they\\'re looking for. The capital of France is definitely Paris. I remember that Paris is not only the administrative capital but also the most populous city in France. \\n\\nNow, they want the data in JSON format, which is a specific data structure. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it\\'s commonly used for data interchange. I should make sure to structure my response as a JSON object with suitable keys.\\n\\nI think the keys \"City\" and \"Population\" would make sense here. \"City\" will be \"Paris\", and \"Population\" should include both the current estimate and historical data. Looking it up in my mind, I recall that as of recent estimates, Paris has a population around 2.1 million people. However, it\\'s important to add that this number can vary since populations can change yearly due to births, deaths, and migration.\\n\\nAlso, including a note about the population figure being approximate acknowledges that it\\'s an estimate and might not be exact. This way, the user knows the information provided is a general figure and should check official sources for the most current data.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format it as a JSON object with these keys. Making sure the syntax is correct, with proper quotation marks and commas in place. No need for any special formatting since it\\'s plain text, but I should double-check that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should also consider if the user needs more detailed information, like the latest statistics from recent years, but since they didn\\'t specify, I\\'ll stick to the most recent and commonly referenced figure. It\\'s better to provide a clear and concise response unless the user asks for more details.\\n\\nSo, in summary, I\\'ll structure the JSON with \"City\" as \"Paris\", \"Population\" as 2.11 million with a note about it being an approximation, and ensure the JSON syntax is correct.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"City\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Population\": \"Approximately 2.11 million (as of 2023 estimates)\"\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '98e3485e1cd341cbaa151732bbc3b6f3', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 465, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.419217824935913}}</strong>"

      "First, I need to figure out what the capital of France is. I remember it's Paris, right? So that's straightforward. Now, the user wants the population, so I should look up the latest data. I think the population numbers can vary each year, so I should probably mention that it's an approximate figure and note the year it's from to avoid any confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, they specified JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a way to structure data. I need to make sure I format it correctly with keys and values. The user might be using this data for a project or maybe integrating it into an app, so accuracy is important. I should double-check the population number to ensure it's up-to-date. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if there's a specific region they're interested in, but since they just asked for the capital, Paris should be fine. I should include the population as an approximate figure and specify the year, maybe 2021, just to have a recent estimate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, considering they mentioned \"population of the capital,\" I should clarify whether that includes just the city proper or the entire metropolitan area. Including the metropolitan area might provide a more comprehensive view. \n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with a key for the city and another for the population. I'll make sure it's clean and easy to read. Oh, and I should probably remind the user that the population can change, just to be thorough. \n",
