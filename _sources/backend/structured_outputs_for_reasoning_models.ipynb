    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

I should call get_current_date with that timezone.<br><br>Next, for the weather, the user is in New York, so I need to specify the city and state. New York is NY, so the city is 'New York' and the state is 'NY'. The temperature unit isn't specified, but the function allows me to choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit. I should probably default to Celsius since it's more commonly used in the US, but maybe I'll note that in the response.<br><br>I need to structure the function calls correctly.

JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

Yes, according to the latest data, the population is approximately 2,174,300 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \"country\". The city is Paris, the population is the number I found, and the country is France.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. The entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. I\\'ll format it properly to avoid any syntax errors.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have the city, population, and country. I\\'ll present this to the user, making sure it\\'s clear and easy to understand. I don\\'t think the user needs anything more detailed, so this should suffice.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need additional information, like the area or age distribution, but since they only asked for population, I\\'ll stick to that.

They asked, \"Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.\" Hmm, let\\'s break this down.\\n\\nFirst, the user is asking for the capital of France, so I should know that\\'s Paris. That\\'s straightforward. Then, they want the population. I know that population figures can change every year, so it\\'s best to provide the most recent estimate. I remember that around 2021, Paris had a population of about 2.2 million people. Just to be thorough, I should check if that\\'s the latest data or if there\\'s a more recent figure.\\n\\nNext, they specified the JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it\\'s a common data format. The user probably wants a structured data format, easy for machines to read. So I need to structure this information into a JSON object. The structure should include a name field with the capital\\'s name, \"Paris,\" the population number, and perhaps a year if they want the data to be tied to a specific time frame. Maybe specify the population as of that year to make it clear.\\n\\nI should also make sure to present this clearly. They might be using this data for a project or presentation, so clarity is key. Maybe I\\'ll include all that info in a JSON object. But wait, should I include any other details? Perhaps not necessary unless the user asks for it. Just the basics: name, population, and year if needed.\\n\\nWait, in the initial example, the assistant left out the year. Since the user didn\\'t specify a particular year, it\\'s better to leave it out to present accurate and up-to-date information. So the JSON should have \"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2219434. That matches approximately the 2021 figure.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is valid, so no syntax errors. Proper use of quotation marks and colons. Maybe mention in the think section that I don\\'t have real-time data so 2021 is the latest I have on hand, but encourage the user to check for more recent information if needed.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the response should be straightforward: provide the JSON structure with the required fields, make sure it\\'s correctly formatted, and explain where each part comes from. That way, the user gets a clear and accurate answer in the format they requested.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"capital\": \"Yes\",\\n  \"population\": 2219434\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\nThe JSON object above contains the following information:\\n- `name`: The name of the city, which is \"Paris\".\\n- `capital`: A confirmation that it is indeed the capital of France.\\n- `population`: The estimated population of Paris, which is approximately 2,219,434 people (as of 2021).', 'meta_info': {'id': '7860f48ac38246f8bd205361984c0fa7', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 618, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.762220859527588}}</strong>"

I know that Paris is the capital, but to be sure, I should confirm that. Paris is indeed the largest city in France and serves as its political and administrative center, so that checks out.\n",
