    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I remember it's over 3 million, but I'm not certain if it's 3.5 or 3.6. I should double-check that.<br><br>Next, I thought about the structure. The user wants JSON, so I need to format it correctly with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\". I should make sure the syntax is correct—no typos, proper commas, and brackets. <br><br>I also considered the user's possible needs. They might be doing a project or a presentation, so providing accurate data is crucial. Maybe they're a student learning about France's capitals or someone compiling demographic data. Either way, precision is key.<br><br>I decided to present the information clearly, ensuring the JSON is valid and easy to read. I included the population as 3.617 million, which I believe is the most recent figure I could recall.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

No, I'm pretty sure France's capital is Paris. Maybe I should double-check that to be certain. Yeah, Paris is where the government is located, and that's the capital.

JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see... Yes, according to the latest data, the population is approximately 2,174,300 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \"country\". The city is Paris, the population is the number I found, and the country is France.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. The entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. I\\'ll format it properly to avoid any syntax errors.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have the city, population, and country. I\\'ll present this to the user, making sure it\\'s clear and easy to understand. I don\\'t think the user needs anything more detailed, so this should suffice.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need additional information, like the area or age distribution, but since they only asked for population, I\\'ll stick to that.

I know that the capital of France is Paris, which is the largest city in both France and the European Union. But I'm not exactly sure about the population numbers. I've heard it's a really big city, probably over ten million people. \\n\\nWait, was I too quick to jump to that conclusion? Maybe I should double-check. I can think about other countries and their capitals. For example, I know that Germany's capital is Berlin, which I believe has around ten million people as well. France's capital is Paris, so it's similar in size. \\n\\nI also remember hearing that Paris is not only the capital but also a global metropolis, so it makes sense that its population would be quite large. Maybe around ten million? But I'm not sure if it's exactly ten. I think it's a bit more. I seem to recall numbers in the tens of millions. \\n\\nWait, no, actually, when I think of Paris, I imagine it's a bit less than twenty million. Maybe in the mid to high teens? I'm a bit confused. Let me see if I can break it down. If Paris is bigger than other capitals, like maybe Germany or Spain's capitals. Spain's capital, Madrid, I think is around 3 million. So, Paris must be much larger than that.\\n\\nI've also heard that cities can have overlapping populations because people work there, even if they don't live there. But that doesn't directly affect the population count for the capital. I think the population figure I'm looking for is the metropolitan area, including suburbs, not just the city proper. So maybe that's why it's higher.\\n\\nWait, is there a difference between the official population figures? I think sometimes they report the urban area population instead of just the city limits. That could make the number higher. So if the metropolitan area is ten million, the city proper might be a bit less. But without exact data, it's hard to say.\\n\\nI remember once I saw a infographic that said Paris has over forty million people, but that doesn't sound right. No, wait, that was probably talking about the whole country's population, not just the capital. So maybe Paris is around ten to twelve million. \\n\\nI should also consider that population figures can vary depending on the source and the year. Also, factors like tourism, job opportunities, and language can influence where people live and work, making the city larger than its original area. \\n\\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure of the exact figure. I think it's around ten to twelve million. But perhaps looking it up would be safer. Wait, I don't have access to external resources right now. I need to make an educated guess based on what I remember. I'll go with ten to twelve million for the population.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is Paris, and its metropolitan area population is estimated to be between ten and twelve million people.\", 'meta_info': {'id': '87b7b91c030e45ab870db5f80db49fd3', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 614, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.422499418258667}}</strong>"
