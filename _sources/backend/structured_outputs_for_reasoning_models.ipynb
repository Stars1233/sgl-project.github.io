    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '4c53a5df72e640bcbe000542857ff2df', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.104497194290161}}</strong>"

First, I know that the capital of France is Paris, so that\\'s my starting point. I remember that Paris is a major city in France, famous for places like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum. But I need specific data about its population.\\n\\nWait, I\\'m not entirely sure about the exact population of Paris. I think it\\'s a big city, so maybe around 2 million people? But I\\'m not certain. Let me think—if I were in France, I\\'d probably hear Paris referred to as the largest city, so that makes sense. But I should probably check some sources to be accurate.\\n\\nI recall that the population figures for cities can vary a lot depending on the year and the source. Maybe I should look for the latest official data. The French government probably releases such information regularly. I think they use censuses or other surveys to get population numbers. \\n\\nI also remember that when it comes to cities in France, Paris is indeed the most populous. Other major cities like Lyon, Marseille, and Lille are also significant, but Paris leads. So, if I were to create a JSON structure, I should include the basic info about Paris as the capital and then the population number.\\n\\nWait, should I include the exact figure? I think I saw once that Paris has a population around 2.1 million. But I\\'m not 100% sure if that\\'s the latest number. Maybe it\\'s slightly more or less. I should maybe phrase it as an approximate figure to be cautious because population numbers can fluctuate year to year.\\n\\nOkay, putting this together, the JSON should have a key like \"capital\" with Paris as the value, and another key like \"population\" with the approximate number. But I need to present it in a proper JSON format. So, it would be something like:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2100000\\n}\\n\\nI think that\\'s it. I should mention that the population figure is approximate and might change. Also, since the user asked for information and population, maybe they expect it in a more detailed JSON with sub-keys. But since the initial answer was straightforward, perhaps that\\'s sufficient for now.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France, Paris, presented in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2100000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nPlease note that the population figure is approximate and may vary slightly depending on the source and year of data.', 'meta_info': {'id': '8fc879bf8e8a499b851787aa344ee399', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 556, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.422600984573364}}</strong>"

I know that Paris is the capital, right? It's the most populous city in France and also the country's capital. Now, I need to find out the current population of Paris. \n",
      "\n",
      "I remember that population figures can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. I think the population number I've heard before is around 2 million. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the most recent number. I should probably double-check that. Maybe I can think about recent years. I know that in 2017, Paris had a population of about 2,165,000. I think that number has grown a bit since then. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also recall that major cities in France tend to have larger populations than smaller ones, but Paris is definitely the biggest. So, if 2017 was around 2.165 million, by 2022, which is the year I think the assistant mentioned, it had grown to about 2.177 million. That seems reasonable, with an increase of roughly 0.012 million, or 12,000 people. That makes sense considering factors like economic growth, tourism, and migration into the city. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting this together, the JSON format should include a key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the value of approximately 2,177,000. I should present this in a JSON structure, making sure it's properly formatted with commas and quotes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, am I missing anything? The user asked for the population, so I don't need to include other cities or regions, just Paris. Also, the population number should be accurate, so I should confirm the exact figure. Maybe I can think about recent news or official statistics. I believe the latest official estimate for 2022 is indeed around 2.177 million. \n",
