    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'f711e3d777014a67a4c8ddba335bf4cf', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.554318428039551}}</strong>"

Hmm, I know that Paris is the capital, but I should double-check that to make sure. I remember learning that Paris has been the capital for a long time, but maybe there\\'s a chance it\\'s changed recently? I don\\'t think so; it\\'s been consistent for a few decades.\\n\\nNow, about the population. I don\\'t remember the exact number, but I think it\\'s in the millions. I recall that major cities in Western Europe have populations over 3 million. Maybe 2 million? Wait, Paris itself is a big city, so the capital might have a larger population than the city proper. Sometimes, the term \"capital\" can refer to the city or the administrative center. I think in this case, the user is referring to the administrative capital, which is still Paris, and the population of the metropolitan area might be around 2.2 million. But I should verify that number to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nLooking at recent estimates, the population has been fluctuating a bit. Maybe around 2.17 million as of 2023? I should include that number in the JSON response. Using the right format is important too—I need to structure it with the correct JSON syntax, using commas and quotation marks properly so it\\'s valid.\\n\\nThe user specifically asked for the information in JSON format, so I should present it neatly, making it easy to copy. I wonder if they\\'ll need it for a database or a project, maybe. Including a note like \"Note: Population data is approximate and may vary slightly depending on the source.\" could be helpful for clarity.\\n\\nI\\'ll structure the response with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"population\" field with two decimal places, and include a note about the data source. That should cover their needs comprehensively.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": \"2183553\",\\n  \"note\": \"Note: Population data is approximate and may vary slightly depending on the source.\"\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '13ffad35ded7434aae7ef7047ee665a9', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 447, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.3907470703125}}</strong>"

I need to make sure I have the correct and most recent data for the population. I remember that population figures can change every year, so I should check the latest estimate. Let me see, as of 2023, the population is around 3,800,000. But I should verify that number to be sure. Maybe I can recall that Paris has a diverse area, so the actual habitable population might be less. I think the metropolitan area is larger, maybe around 12 million, but the Capital city proper is about 3.8 million. I should present both in case the user is interested in the metropolitan area. Also, considering the format, JSON is straightforward, so I'll structure it with \"capital\" and \"population\" fields. I should make sure the numbers are accurate and cite the data year if possible. I don't want to give incorrect information, so double-checking the population stats would be a good idea. I think that's all for this query. Time to put it together in JSON format as requested.\n",
