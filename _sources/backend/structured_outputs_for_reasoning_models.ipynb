    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. That\\'s straightforward—it\\'s Paris. So I\\'ll note that.\\n\\nNext, they want the population. I\\'m not exactly up-to-date on the latest numbers, but I know it\\'s a major city with a large population. I\\'ll go with the approximate figure of around 2.2 million people. I should mention that this is an estimate as exact numbers can change over time.\\n\\nNow, structuring this into JSON. JSON typically uses key-value pairs. So keys like \"city,\" \"population\" make sense. Since the user included \"country\" in their example, I\\'ll keep it consistent. \\n\\nI should format it properly, with square brackets for the array and ensure all commas and brackets are correctly placed to avoid errors. \\n\\nWait, the user might need this for a project or data analysis. Providing a precise JSON structure is important so it can be easily used in other applications. Maybe they\\'re a student working on a geography project or a developer integrating population data.\\n\\nI should make sure the response is clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary jargon. The JSON doesn\\'t need to be pretty-printed unless specified, so keeping it simple is better. \\n\\nDouble-checking all the elements: city name, country, population. Yep, that\\'s all the information requested. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively. \\n\\nI don\\'t see any edge cases here; the request is pretty straightforward. No need to overcomplicate. Just provide the facts in the required JSON format.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"population\": 2200000\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '243fde4124334a64bf805250c6dc2b29', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 389, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.54416823387146}}</strong>"
