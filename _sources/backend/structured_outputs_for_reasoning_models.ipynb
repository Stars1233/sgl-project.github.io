    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'c8d651d1bffa403691fa3a605c203e6c', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.552915096282959}}</strong>"

They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let\\'s break this down.\\n\\nFirst, the capital of France is definitely Paris. Got it. So the key pieces of information would be where it\\'s located, which is straightforward—Paris is the capital. \\n\\nNext, the population. I remember reading somewhere that Paris has a pretty large population, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million people. But wait, that seems a bit low. Maybe it\\'s more than that. Let me think—I recall hearing that Paris is one of the most populous cities in Western Europe, so perhaps around 2.1 to 2.3 million? I think it\\'s been growing a bit over the years.\\n\\nNow, how to structure this in JSON. JSON format requires a key-value structure, so I should include \"capital\" with the name \"Paris\" and \"population\" as the number. Oh, and I should make sure the value is a number, not a string. \\n\\nWait, the user just asked for the population, so I should probably specify that. Should I write it as an integer or a number with decimal places? Since population data can be approximate, I think using a number without decimals would be fine.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have a keys \"capital\" and \"population\". The \"capital\" is \"Paris\", and the population is 2,158,000 or something like that. I should double-check that number to be accurate. I think the exact figure is around 2.158 million, so 2158000 would be precise.\\n\\nIs there anything else I need to consider? Maybe units? No, the user just asked for the population number, so days are fine without units. \\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct—using quotes around the keys and string values, and the comma after the last key-value pair. \\n\\nSo, wrapping it up, I\\'ll format it like the example I think of every time someone asks for JSON info.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the JSON information about the capital of France, including its location and population:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2158000\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '6ab9f8c0162d49c290704b6834c01a16', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 494, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.654056072235107}}</strong>"
