    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I remember it's over 3 million, but I'm not certain if it's 3.5 or 3.6. I should double-check that.<br><br>Next, I thought about the structure. The user wants JSON, so I need to format it correctly with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\". I should make sure the syntax is correct—no typos, proper commas, and brackets. <br><br>I also considered the user's possible needs. They might be doing a project or a presentation, so providing accurate data is crucial. Maybe they're a student learning about France's capitals or someone compiling demographic data. Either way, precision is key.<br><br>I decided to present the information clearly, ensuring the JSON is valid and easy to read. I included the population as 3.617 million, which I believe is the most recent figure I could recall.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

No, I'm pretty sure France's capital is Paris. Maybe I should double-check that to be certain. Yeah, Paris is where the government is located, and that's the capital.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the current date and time in New York along with the weather. Let me start by breaking down what the user is asking for. They want two things: the current date and time for New York, and the weather in New York right now.<br><br>First, I remember that I have access to two functions: get_current_weather and get_current_date. The get_current_weather function requires a city, state, and unit. The get_current_date function needs a timezone.<br><br>Since the user is in New York, I need to determine the correct parameters for both functions. For the weather, I think the city is \"New York\". I'm not sure about the state abbreviation. I believe New York is NY, so the state should be \"NY\". The unit is probably Fahrenheit since that's a common unit used in the US, but I'm not 100% certain. I'll have to consider both possibilities.<br><br>For the date and time, the timezone is \"America/New_York\" because that's the standard timezone for New York. I don't think I need to specify a particular time format or anything else for get_current_date.<br><br>Wait, but looking back at the function definitions, get_current_date requires a timezone parameter. So I can construct the parameters for get_current_date as {\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}.<br><br>Now, for get_current_weather, I need to include city, state, and unit. The city is \"New York\", state is \"NY\", and unit could be either \"celsius\" or \"fahrenheit\". I might need to check both, but perhaps the user expects Fahrenheit since it's more familiar in the US.<br><br>Putting it all together, I should call get_current_weather with the parameters and get_current_date with the timezone. I should mention both results in my response, providing the date, time, temperature, and weather condition.<br><br>I should also make sure to format the function calls correctly, using the specified start and end tags, and include the parameters in a JSON format within the function calls. I need to ensure that I'm only using one function at a time, so I'll handle them separately.<br><br>Wait, but should I call both functions in a single message or separate messages? The user's instruction says to use the functions, but doesn't specify. Since the user is asking for both date and weather, I think it's appropriate to provide both in the same response, perhaps separated by a line or a sentence.<br><br>I should also remember to add sources where I get the information, like the function definitions, so the user knows where the data comes from. Maybe something like \"Using the get_current_weather function from the provided API\" and \"Using the get_current_date function from the provided API.\"<br><br>Let me double-check the function parameters to make sure I'm not missing anything. For get_current_weather, the required parameters are city, state, and unit. For get_current_date, it's just the timezone. Both functions seem straightforward.<br><br>I think I'm ready to structure the response. I'll write the function calls for both, and then present the expected outputs based on standard responses from these functions. For example, the current date and time in New York, and the weather details like temperature and condition.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what exactly they\\'re looking for. The capital of France is definitely Paris, right? So, I should gather accurate data about Paris concerning its population and other relevant information.\\n\\nI think the user might be a student working on a project or maybe someone creating a database entry. They needed the data structured clearly in JSON, which is useful for data handling. JSON is preferred because it\\'s easy to read and write, and widely supported.\\n\\nNow, I should look up the most recent population figures for Paris. I remember it\\'s around 2 million people, but I should cross-verify the exact number. Maybe I can check a reliable source like the official Paris public website or the latest census data from France. Let\\'s say the figure provided is 2,165,065. That seems accurate enough and gives a snapshot of the current population as of 2023.\\n\\nNext, besides population, I need other key pieces of information. The area of Paris is something that\\'s often queried, so including that makes the JSON more informative. I think Paris covers about 7.5 square kilometers. That\\'s pretty small compared to other capitals but makes sense geographically. Also, the metropolitan area might be a point of interest, so mentioning that it\\'s around 10.5 square kilometers could be helpful.\\n\\n geo and demo fields are standard in JSON data, so including those with the appropriate details will make the response comprehensive. I should structure everything under a capitals object, making it easy to navigate.\\n\\nWait, should I include additional attributes or keep it simple? Since the user asked for information and population, keeping it concise but useful is probably best. So, sticking to essential fields like name, population, area, and metropolitan area area should suffice.\\n\\nI should also ensure that all the units are clear. Population numbers will be in people, and areas in square kilometers. Making sure the JSON syntax is correct is crucial; commas in the right places, proper quotation marks, avoiding any brackets unless necessary. Maybe use single quotes for both keys and string values.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look neat without any unnecessary nesting. I\\'ll double-check the numbers to make sure I didn\\'t include any incorrect data from a memory dump. Accuracy is key, especially for population figures, as they can change from year to year.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON structure as the answer. It\\'s important to explain in the response that the population figure is approximate and that the last update was in a specific year to set the context. This transparency helps in understanding the data\\'s basis and reliability.\\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user will get a clean, well-structured JSON response containing the necessary information about Paris\\'s population, area, and metropolitan area size. This should meet their needs effectively.\\n</think>\\n\\nSure! Here is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capitals\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2165065,  // Approximate population as of 2023\\n    \"geo\": {\\n      \"region\": \"Île-de-France\",\\n      \"coordinates\": {\\n        \"start\": \"-3.7313\",\\n        \"end\": \"4.8573\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n    \"demo\": {\\n      \" metropolitan_area_area\": 10.5\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet me know if you need further details!', 'meta_info': {'id': 'bef473be210443f297924602b3c3e8b1', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 745, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.768131732940674}}</strong>"
