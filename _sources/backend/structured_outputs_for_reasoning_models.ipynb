    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

I need to figure out how to structure this using the functions provided. <br><br>First, I should use the `get_current_date` function. The parameters required are the timezone. Since the user is in New York, I'll need to specify 'America/New_York'. I remember that timezones can vary, but I think 'New_York' without the underscore might not work, so the correct format is 'America/New_York'. <br><br>Next, for the weather, I'll use the `get_current_weather` function. The parameters needed are the city, state, and unit. The city is 'New York', but I need to include the state abbreviation, which is 'NY'. The unit should be 'fahrenheit' since the user didn't specify, but I should double-check if the function allows default values or if I need to include all required parameters. Looking at the function's parameters, it says 'unit' is required, so I have to specify it. <br><br>I should make sure each function call is on its own line, following the specified format. For the date, it's just the timezone parameter. For the weather, it's city, state, and unit. I'll structure each function call separately, using the correct syntax with curly braces and the right tags. <br><br>I also need to remember to include the source in the response. Since I'm using these functions, I'll reference the tool instructions as the source. <br><br>Putting it all together, I'll first call `get_current_date` with the timezone, then call `get_current_weather` with the necessary details. Each function call will be on its own line as per the format instructions. <br><br>I should also ensure that the parameters are correctly formatted as JSON. For example, the city and state should be in quotes, and the unit should be a string. <br><br>Double-checking, yes, that looks right.

First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s a fact I\\'ve learned before. Now, the user specifically wants the population, so I need to provide that number. I\\'m pretty sure the most recent population figure I have is from 2022. I think it was around 3.5 million people. \\n\\nWait, I should make sure about that number. I don\\'t want to give them incorrect information. Maybe I should double-check that figure. I recall that Paris has been growing a bit, but not as rapidly as some other cities. According to the most recent census or official stats, the population is indeed approximately 3.5 million. \\n\\nAlright, now putting this into JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll need to structure it properly. The keys should be straightforward: one for the city name and another for the population. I\\'ll make sure the values are accurate and probably round the number to a reasonable figure for simplicity. \\n\\nI should also consider the response style. The user provided an example with a friendly greeting and the information neatly packaged in a JSON object. I\\'ll follow that structure to maintain consistency and clarity. \\n\\nNo, wait, the user didn\\'t specify if they want just the population or any additional information. They asked specifically for the population, but it\\'s good to include the city name for context. That way, anyone reading the JSON will immediately know which city\\'s population they\\'re looking at.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format it with proper syntax: start with a comma after each object, use double quotes for keys and string values, and the number as an integer since it\\'s a population count. \\n\\nI think that covers everything the user is asking for. They might be using this data for a report, a presentation, or maybe just for personal knowledge. Either way, providing accurate and clear information is key. I don\\'t see any need for additional fields unless they specify more details, so I\\'ll stick to what\\'s requested.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '0b1f4d16f16d40cb93b441639481f4b8', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 464, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.320282697677612}}</strong>"
