    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",
    "- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty straightforward, but I should double-check to make sure I\\'m correct. Paris is definitely the administrative center, so it\\'s the official capital. I don\\'t think Orléans or any other city holds that title.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember from a previous class that Paris has a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. Population figures can change every year, so I need to get the most recent data. Maybe around 2020 or 2023. I believe it\\'s in the mid-300,000s. Let me see, I think it\\'s around 3,700,000. But I\\'m not 100% certain. I should verify that.\\n\\nAlso, it would be good to include some more details like the area and the median age to provide a more comprehensive answer. The area of Paris is about 105 square kilometers, which is quite significant. The median age, from what I recall, is around 37.7 years, indicating a relatively young population.\\n\\nPutting this all together in JSON format, I should structure it neatly with keys like \"capital\", \"population\", \"area\", and \"median_age\". That way, the information is organized and easy to read. I need to make sure the numbers are accurate and the formatting is correct with commas and brackets.\\n\\nWait, I should also note that the population is approximate because exact numbers can vary depending on the source and the year it\\'s recorded. It\\'s important to add a disclaimer about that to avoid misleading the user.\\n\\nSo, my final JSON would look something like this:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3700000,\\n  \"area\": 105,\\n  \"median_age\": 37.7,\\n  \"note\": \"Population is approximate and may vary\"\\n}\\n\\nI think that covers all the necessary information the user asked for. Let me double-check each field to ensure accuracy, especially the population number because that\\'s the key piece they were asking about. Yes, 3,700,000 sounds right for Paris. The other details seem accurate as well.\\n\\nI should also consider if there\\'s any possibility of the information being outdated, so advising the user to check a reliable source for the most current data could be helpful. But since they asked for the information in JSON, I\\'ll provide it as I have here.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3700000,\\n  \"area\": 105,\\n  \"median_age\": 37.7,\\n  \"note\": \"Population is approximate and may vary\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON provides the requested information about the capital of France, including its population, area, median age, and a note indicating that the population figure is approximate.', 'meta_info': {'id': '041d8a62eaf3433a982899b631504ba8', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 659, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.102883577346802}}</strong>"
