    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Alright, so the user is in New York and wants the current date and time along with the weather. Let me break down how I can help them step by step.<br><br>First, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user mentioned they want both the date and time, and the weather. From the available functions, I see that 'get_current_date' fetches the date and time for a given timezone, and 'get_current_weather' gets the weather in a specific location. Perfect, I can use both.<br><br>Next, I need to determine the parameters for each function. For 'get_current_date', the required parameter is 'timezone', and the user is in New York, so I'll set that. The function should be called as <function=get_current_date>{{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}}</function>.<br><br>Then, for the weather, I need the city and state. The user is in New York, so the city is 'New York' and the state is 'NY'. I'll use the 'get_current_weather' function with these parameters. The call will look like <function=get_current_weather>{{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}}</function>. I chose Fahrenheit because the unit wasn't specified, but it's a common request, so it's a safe default.<br><br>I should also include a source for the weather information. Since I'm using the function 'get_current_weather', I can reference the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as a reliable source. That way, the user knows where the information is coming from if they want to verify it.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll send two separate function calls: one for the date and time, and another for the weather, each with their respective parameters. I'll make sure each function call is on its own line, as per the user's instructions, to keep things clear and organized.<br><br>I should double-check that I'm using the correct function names and parameters. The 'get_current_date' function requires a timezone string, and I'm providing 'America/New_York', which is correct. For the weather, I'm including city, state, and unit, which are all required parameters. <br><br>I also need to ensure that I'm following the format strictly. Each function call starts with <function=, followed by the function name, then the parameters in a JSON object, and ends with </function>. No extra text or explanations should be in the response; it should be concise and follow the specified format.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure to add the source in the response so the user knows where the weather data is coming from. This adds credibility and helps them verify the information if needed. I don't need to include any other functions or parameters since the user only asked for these two pieces of information.<br><br>Alright, I think I've covered all the bases. Time to put it all together in the correct format and send the response.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{  <br>  \"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"  <br>}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{  <br>  \"city\": \"New York\",  <br>  \"state\": \"NY\",  <br>  \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"  <br>}</function></strong>"

Hmm, okay, let\\'s break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s a given, but I should make sure, right? Paris is the administrative capital, right? Although sometimes people might confuse it with Lyon, which is the economic hub, but no, Paris still holds the title of the capital.\\n\\nNow, the user is asking for the population. I remember from general knowledge that Paris is the most populous city in France. But wait, I\\'m not exactly sure about the exact figure. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I\\'m not 100% confident. Let me try to recall some background info or maybe think about places I know. If I remember correctly, Paris has a significant influence on global culture, so having a big population makes sense.\\n\\nBut wait, I should verify this. Maybe I heard it\\'s over 2 million, but I could be mixing it up with other cities. Alternatively, I\\'ve heard estimates that Paris could be around 2.1 or 2.2 million. However, I also need to consider that population numbers can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. So the number might vary depending on the source and the time of the year.\\n\\nHmm, the user hasn\\'t specified a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate I have. I think the latest official data might be around the 2020s, but I\\'m not certain. Also, places like Le grew up to think, what sources do I trust for such data? Maybe I should mention that the population figure can vary and suggest checking recent data from official sources like INSEE for the most accurate and up-to-date information.\\n\\nPutting this all together, I should structure the response clearly. The user wants it in JSON format, so I\\'ll create an object with \\'capital\\' as the key and the population as its value. I should keep the format simple and straightforward, like {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": {“year”: “number”}}.\\n\\nWait, actually, looking back at the initial response I gave, it only included the current population without specifying the year. Maybe I should clarify that the figure is as of recent data and suggest looking it up for the latest stats. But as the user\\'s response in the thinking process above just provided the population without specifying the year, perhaps I didn\\'t elaborate on that. However, it\\'s probably good practice to mention that figures can change and advise checking official sources.\\n\\nSo, in summary, the response should include capital Paris, population in millions, and a note encouraging the user to verify for the most current data.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe population of the capital of France is Paris. As of recent estimates, the population of Paris is approximately 2,193,000 people. \\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2193000\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'd0157b3315594234bc295fa1da21f951', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 637, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.793331623077393}}</strong>"

I know that Paris is the capital, so that's a given. Now, I need to find the most recent population figure for Paris.

I know that migration plays a role, especially in cities like Paris where it's a major economic hub.\n",
