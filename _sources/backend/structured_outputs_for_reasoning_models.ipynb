    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '1a633d7477f24e94bb09d44720453712', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.655696392059326}}</strong>"

They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is巴黎 (Paris). So, I\\'ll start by identifying that the country is France, the city is Paris, and it\\'s located in Île-de-France, specifically in the Val-d’Oise district, administrative territorial area 92.\\n\\nNext, for the population. I remember that Paris is one of the most populous cities in the world, but exact numbers can change. I think the population was around 94 million maybe a few years back. I should probably check the current estimate to make sure it\\'s accurate. Let me recall or refer to memory—I believe it\\'s currently around 9,408,798 as of recent data. It might have grown a bit, but it\\'s a stable number, so I think that\\'s a safe estimate to use.\\n\\nNow, structuring this in JSON. I remember JSON uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll need to create a structure with the country, city, district, and population as separate key fields, each paired with their respective values in quotes. I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct—commas in the right places, colons after each key, and proper use of quotation marks.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll start with the country, then city, district, and population. I\\'ll make sure each is a string enclosed in double quotes and the population is a numerical value without quotes. Testing the JSON to ensure it\\'s valid would be good, but since I can\\'t run code here, I\\'ll just carefully check the syntax.\\n\\nI should also present it clearly so the user can easily see the information. Maybe encapsulate it in a box or use a heading for clarity. The user seems to expect a straightforward response without any additional fluff, so I\\'ll keep it concise yet informative.\\n\\nDouble-checking the population figure is crucial. I don\\'t want to provide outdated or incorrect numbers. From what I recall, Paris has grown steadily, so 9.4 million seems plausible. I\\'ll proceed with that number and present it accurately.\\n\\nIn summary, the response should include the country, city, district, population, all in a JSON structure. I need to ensure accuracy in the population and correct JSON formatting. Once I have that, I can present it neatly to the user as they requested.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"district\": \"Île-de-France\",\\n  \"population\": 9408798\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'c68a0e34774044dca6f3c9b9a49ee8a9', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 561, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 8.629270553588867}}</strong>"

First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty straightforward. Now, I need to find the current population of Paris. I remember that populations can change over time, so I should make sure to use the most recent data available. I think the population of Paris is around 2 million people, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact number. Maybe it's a bit more or less? Let me double-check that. Oh, right, Paris has grown quite a bit over the years, especially with tourism and international students. I believe the current population is approximately 2,175,000. That seems about right. \n",

They just asked for the population, so I'll stick with the current estimate. Now, organizing this into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll structure it with \"capital\" as the key and \"paris\" as its value. Then, another key for population with the number I found. I'll make sure to format it correctly, using proper syntax to avoid any errors. \n",
