    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the current date and time in New York, along with the weather. The user mentioned using functions called get_current_weather and get_current_date. Let me break this down.<br><br>First, I need to get the current date and time for New York's timezone. I remember that timezones can affect the date and time, so it's important to specify that. The function get_current_date requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone value. That makes sense because New York uses this timezone.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I need to provide the city, state, and unit. The city is New York, obviously. The state would be 'NY' since that's the two-letter abbreviation for New York. The unit is probably Fahrenheit because that's the default in the US, but I'm not sure. I should check the function's parameters to confirm. Oh, yes, the function allows specifying 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit', so I'll include 'fahrenheit' as the unit.<br><br>Wait, I'm supposed to call each function separately. So I'll first call get_current_date with the timezone parameter. Then, I'll call get_current_weather with city, state, and unit. I need to make sure each function call is properly formatted with the required parameters. <br><br>Let me structure this. For the date, the function call would be <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>. For the weather, it's <function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function>. <br><br>I should also mention the sources, but since I'm directly using the function calls, maybe I don't need external sources. Wait, the example in the instructions mentioned adding sources when using search results, but here I'm just executing the functions, so perhaps I don't need to add any sources. <br><br>Hmm, no, maybe I should just stick to the function calls as per the user's instructions. I should ensure that each function is called correctly without any extra information. <br><br>So, putting it all together, I'll first get the date and then the weather using the respective functions with the necessary parameters. I think that should do it.<br><br><br>content: To retrieve the current date and time in New York, I will use the `get_current_date` function with the `timezone` parameter set to 'America/New_York'. Additionally, to obtain the weather information, I will use the `get_current_weather` function, providing the city name, state abbreviation, and the desired unit of temperature.<br><br><function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '4ac45b3c73d3414db40a20b2ce348e08', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.78435754776001}}</strong>"

I immediately thought the capital is Paris, so I started with that. Now, I need to recall or look up the current population. I remember that Paris has been growing a bit, so I believe it\\'s over 3 million. Let me check some recent stats to confirm. Yeah, in 2021, Paris had a population of around 3,509,000.\\n\\nNext, I should structure this information neatly. They asked for JSON, so I\\'ll format it with the country as \"France\" and the city as \"Paris.\" I\\'ll include separate fields for the population number and an approximate figure for context. Adding some descriptive labels will make it clear what each field represents. I think using \"official_population\" and \"approximate_population\" makes sense here.\\n\\nI should also include units in the description, so people know it\\'s in thousands. Making sure the JSON syntax is correct is important—proper commas, quotation marks, and brackets. I double-checked to avoid any syntax errors. \\n\\nI wonder if the user is a student working on a project or maybe a researcher. They might need this data for a report or a presentation. Giving it in JSON format is practical because it\\'s easy to copy and use in applications. I should make sure the JSON is clean and well-formatted so it\\'s useful for them. \\n\\nIs there anything else the user might need? They might also be interested in recent trends or projections. But since they only asked for the current info, I kept it straightforward. I think providing both exact and approximate figures is helpful in case they need a range. Also, maybe they want to do some calculations or comparisons, so including both gives them more flexibility.\\n\\nI considered whether to provide sources, but since they just asked for the info, I\\'ll stick to the numbers. However, it\\'s good to remember for any future interactions whether sourcing is necessary. All in all, I think the response I provided covers their needs effectively in JSON format.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3509000,\\n  \"description\": \"Paris is the capital city of France.

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. The capital is Paris, so I need to provide accurate data. I'll start by recalling the current population. I think it's around 2 million people. But wait, is that up to date? I should check recent estimates, but since I can't browse the web, I'll stick with the most recent figure I have, which is approximately 2,100,000 as of 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the official name of the capital is Paris, so that's straightforward. The administrative region is the Île-de-France region. That's correct because Paris is part of a large administrative area that includes other cities like Lyon and Lille.\n",
      "\n",
      "The area of Paris is about 105 square kilometers. I remember that Paris is a major city, so this size makes sense. The population density would be the population divided by the area, so 2,100,000 divided by 105 km². Let me calculate that: 2,100,000 / 105 = 20,000 people per km². That seems high but accurate for a dense city like Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "The metropolitan area is much larger, around 12 million people, which I've heard before. It's important to note that because the metropolitan area includes surrounding regions, not just the city limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should present all this information in a JSON format. I'll structure it with keys like \"official_name,\" \"administrative_region,\" \"area,\" \"population,\" and \"metropolitan_area.\" I'll make sure the numbers are formatted correctly, using commas where necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, does the JSON need to be pretty printed or just valid? The user didn't specify, so I'll go with a clean, valid JSON structure without extra formatting. I'll ensure that the population numbers are correctly placed under their respective keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll format the JSON with proper syntax, making sure there are commas where needed and no trailing commas that could cause errors. I'll double-check the commas between the key-value pairs to ensure the JSON is valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's all. The user wanted the information in JSON, so this should meet their needs. I hope I didn't miss any key details. Paris is a significant city, so the data should be accurate based on my knowledge cutoff in 2023.\n",
