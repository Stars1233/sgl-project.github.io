    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",
    "- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to generate information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format. Hmm, where do I start? Well, I know that Paris is the main city in France, but I'm not exactly sure about all the details. Let me think about what information is typically included about a city's capital.<br><br>First, the name of the city is obviously Paris. Then, the country it's the capital of, which is France. I remember that Paris is the largest city in France, but I'm not sure about its population. I think it's a big city, maybe around 2 million people? I'm not certain, though. I should probably look that up, but since I'm just brainstorming, I'll go with that for now.<br><br>Next, the location. Paris is located in the northern part of France, specifically in the Île-de-France region. I think it's on the Seine River, which is a major river there. The Eiffel Tower is in Paris, so that's a key landmark. I should include that.<br><br>Language-wise, Paris is a center for French culture, so French is definitely the predominant language. I'm not sure about minority languages or dialects, but maybe there are some, but I don't know which ones. I'll just note that French is the main language.<br><br>Cuisine is another aspect. Paris is famous for its food, like baguettes, croissants, and wine. I should mention some of the popular dishes, maybe something like \"Baguette,Croissant, and wine.\"<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has a well-developed public transit system, like the Métro, which is a subway network. I think there are trams and buses too. I should include that the public transport is extensive.<br><br>Economically, Paris is a significant hub. I believe it's home to many multinational companies and financial institutions. Maybe something like \"home to many multinational companies and financial institutions.\"<br><br>Culturally, Paris is rich in museums, art, and historical sites. The Louvre and the Musée d'Histéritage come to mind. Also, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so I should mention that.<br><br>I should also include some notable landmarks. The Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, Notre-Dame, and the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. Maybe the gardens around the Eiffel Tower, like Champ de Mars.<br><br>Now, putting this all together into JSON format. I need to structure it with the key \"capital\" and then include all these details as a value. I'll organize them under different categories for clarity, like \"name,\" \"country,\" \"population,\" \"location,\" \"language,\" \"cuisine,\" \"transportation,\" \"economy,\" \"culture,\" and \"landmarks.\"<br><br>Wait, I'm not sure about the population figure. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should double-check that, but for now, I'll proceed with that number.<br><br>Also, I'm not sure if Paris is the only city in France that's a capital. I think there are others, but Paris is the main one. So, I should specify that Paris is the main capital.<br><br>I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks. Each key should be in quotes, and the entire structure should be an object within the \"capital\" key.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each category as a key, and the corresponding details as values. I'll make sure to include all the points I thought of, but I'll keep it concise and relevant.<br><br>I think that's a good start. Now, I'll format it properly in JSON, ensuring that each key is correctly spelled and the values are accurate based on my understanding.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the information about the capital of France and present it in JSON format. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about France. I know that Paris is the capital, but I should double-check that to be sure. Yeah, Paris is definitely the administrative and cultural center of France.<br><br>Now, I need to gather more details about Paris. Let me think about its location. Paris is located in the northern part of France, right? It's in the Île-de-France region. I remember that it's an island, so that's an important geographical feature. The coordinates are something like 48°51′N 2°28′E. I think that's correct, but I should make sure. Maybe I can visualize it on a map—Paris is in the north, near the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River.<br><br>Next, I should consider the history of Paris. It's been a major city for centuries. I know that during the French Revolution, Paris was the center of the revolution, and it's still a significant cultural and political hub today. It's also a global city, attracting millions of visitors each year.<br><br>Economically, Paris is a major financial and business center. I believe it's home to many multinational corporations and financial institutions. The Paris Stock Exchange comes to mind, and there are a lot of big companies based there. The city is also known for its fashion industry, with some of the world's most famous brands having headquarters in Paris.<br><br>Culturally, Paris is rich with art, literature, and history. The Louvre Museum is one of the world's largest art museums, and it's located in Paris. There's also the Musée d'Orsay, which is another major cultural institution. The city has a vibrant nightlife, with famous bars and clubs. I think places like Le Marais and Montmartre are known for their lively nightlife and artistic scenes.<br><br>Demographically, Paris is a large city, but it's also one of the most densely populated in the world. The metropolitan area covers a vast area, extending beyond the city limits into the outer suburbs. The population is diverse, with people from many different countries and backgrounds living there.<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has an extensive public transit system, including the Métro, which is a highly efficient subway network. There are also buses, trams, and trolleys that serve the city. The Seine River has several bridges and ferries that connect different parts of the city.<br><br>I should also mention some notable landmarks. The Eiffel Tower is a must-see, and the Arc de Triomphe is another iconic structure. The Notre-Dame Cathedral is a major religious site, though it's had some recent renovations and changes due to the fire that occurred in 2019.<br><br>In terms of language, Paris is a city where French is the official language, but it's also a multicultural city. People from around the world speak English, Spanish, German, and other languages there, contributing to a very international atmosphere.<br><br>I think I've covered the main points. Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. I'll start with the basic information: name, location, and status. Then, I'll add historical, economic, cultural, demographic, transportation, and notable landmarks sections. Each section will have relevant details under subkeys.<br><br>Wait, I should make sure that the JSON syntax is correct. I'll use proper braces, commas, and quotation marks. Also, I'll ensure that the keys are in lowercase letters as per JSON standards. Let me organize the information step by step.<br><br>First, the capital object will have properties like name, location, and status. Then, each additional section will be an object with its own properties.

So, the main object would have a \"country\" key pointing to \"France,\" and the \"capital\" key pointing to \"Paris.\" Under \"capital,\" I can have an \"info\" array that includes population, landmarks, and maybe some other info like the date it became the capital or the official name.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I need to provide information about the capital of France in JSON format. I remember that the capital of France is Paris, but I\\'m not entirely sure about all the details. Let me think through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the basic information: Paris is the capital city. That\\'s straightforward. It\\'s located in the northern part of France, right in the heart of the city. I also recall that maybe it\\'s on the Seine River. Wait, I think it\\'s located on the Left Bank of the Seine. Yeah, that sounds right.\\n\\nNow, thinking about Paris, it\\'s a historical city. It\\'s been the capital for a long time, probably for a couple centuries. I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s been the capital since the 14th century, maybe the 13th? Anyway, being a capital, it\\'s a major administrative, economic, and cultural center.\\n\\nCulturally, Paris is known for so many things. The Eiffel Tower is there, which is the most iconic landmark. The Louvre Museum is another big one, definitely a must-visit. There\\'s also theívelre, the oldest surviving operatic company in the world. So, cultural landmarks are definitely a part of its identity.\\n\\nPolitically, as the capital, Paris probably has significant government buildings. It\\'s likely home to the French Parliament building. I\\'m a bit fuzzy on the exact building name, but I think it\\'s called La JagALL. It\\'s a big, imposing structure, I believe it\\'s in Palace of Palace Law.\\n\\nEconomically, Paris is a center for finance and business. Perhaps places like the Bastille Museum of Fine Arts, which is a major art museum. Or maybe零售商 like Galeries Favre? Wait, no, Galeries Favre is a mall, I think it\\'s located elsewhere. Maybe I\\'m mixing things up. Perhaps other businesses like Sénat, which is the Senate Building? Yes, that\\'s one of the important government buildings.\\n\\nIn terms of neighborhoods, Paris has many well-known areas. Le Marais is probably one of them, known for its arts and nightlife. Montmartre is another, famous for its artistic community and hills surrounding the area. La Villette is beautiful with its gardens and statues, I should include that as a park and green space.\\n\\n sonate de F Evans? battling cats or something? Wait, no, that doesn\\'t make sense. Maybe I confused it withumbnail\". Maybe Flickr? No, that\\'s a website. Perhaps the catFacade? Wait, Sonate is a dog in بيt approves favicon.ico. Maybe I\\'m mixing up favicon names. I should check, but since I\\'m trying to recall, maybe it\\'s Sonate, which is the favicon for some sites?\\n\\n French Con_rep? Maybe not. I\\'m a bit stuck here. Perhaps there\\'s a specific building named Sonate. Alternatively, it might be a typo for something else. I\\'m not too sure, so I might skip that or look it up if I can. But given I\\'m trying to answer without looking it up, I\\'ll proceed with what I think.\\n\\nNow, moving on. The geographical features: Paris is surrounded by inheriting rivers and snapchat fences. Wait, that doesn\\'t parse well. Probably meant to describe the surroundings, maybe referring to rivers and modern infrastructure like snapchat fences—though I think snapchat fences are part of mobile infrastructure, not a natural feature. So, perhaps the sentence was meant differently, like \\'Paris is flanked by rivers and modern snapchat fences?\\' Not sure, but maybe.\\n\\n列出 major landmarks: I\\'ve got the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the two types of bridges: Pont Alexandre III and Pont Montparnasse. The Tuileries Gardens, which I think is a luxurious garden. The Musée Rodin, another major art museum. And Notre-Dame Cathedral, which is quite famous, though it\\'s been damaged and undergoing renovations.\\n\\nI also recall that Paris attracts a lot of tourists, known for things likeikipedia, which is an encyclopedic website, but also for Union Jack flags, which I think are not placed there. Maybe江 Or perhaps it\\'s about something else. Wait, maybe errno or is involved? I\\'m getting confused. Perhaps I should focus more on factual information and omit less relevant details.\\n\\nIn summary, the JSON should include some key points about Paris as the capital, its location, landmarks, historical significance, economic and administrative roles. Let me try to organize these thoughts.\\n\\nName would be Paris, Country France, established as a capital around 13th century, serving it as cultural, administrative, and economic center. Located in northern France on the Left Bank of the Seine. Major landmarks include Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Tuileries Gardens, Musée Rodin, Notre-Dame Cathedral. Political seat with government buildings like the Palace of Palace Law, home to the French Parliament. Ideally, I should structure this into categories for better readability, maybe like location, establishment, landmarks, and so on.\\n\\nWait, I think in JSON format, you would structure it with keys like \"name\", \"country\", \"established\", \"functions\", \"coordinates\", \"landmarks\", and \"buildings\". Each with their respective values. I\\'ll need to get the accurate details, such as the year Paris became the capital, which I think was around 1305, so I can write \\'1305\\' as the establishment year.\\n\\nRegarding landmarks, I can list the most famous ones. Building names might include Palace of Palace Law, but that seems repetitive. Maybe \\'Palais Royal\\' or \\'Palais des Congrès\\' for the Palace of Palace Law. Not entirely sure, so I have to make it as accurate as possible from my memory.\\n\\nI should also note that Paris is known for its rich history, art, and cultural significance. Therefore, for the \\'functions\\' key, I can list it as \\'Cultural, administrative, and economic center of France\\'.\\n\\nWhen it comes to geographical location, it\\'s in northern France, specifically at the confluence of the Seine and the Loire rivers, on the Left Bank.\\n\\nIn the landmarks section, I can place Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, Tuileries Gardens, Musée Rodin, and Notre-Dame Cathedral as major attractions. I think the Eiffel Tower is the most iconic, so it\\'s definitely a must-include.\\n\\nFor political roles, besides government buildings, the City of Paris is the administrative center, plus it\\'s home to the château de la Huret,I think, which houses the regional government.\\n\\nEconomically, apart from being a financial hub, it\\'s home to big companies like BP and Unilever, I believe. Also, areas like Le Marais and Montmartre are known for their businesses and commercial vibrancy.\\n\\nTransportation-wise, Paris has the quartierなどを\\tdrawn LEV or something – maybe that\\'s too much to include. Alternatively, it\\'s known for its public transportation system like the SNCF for trains.\\n\\nI think I have enough information to structure the JSON now. I\\'ll organize it into categories like name, country, coordinates, establishment, functions, landmarks, buildings, and historical. Maybe add some neutral trivia like the cat favicon, if I can recall it correctly.\\n\\nWait, earlier I thought about favicon.ico, but I\\'m not certain. Maybe it\\'s Sonate.front? I think that\\'s a thing where companies use favicon.ico links to their homepages. So, as of 2023, it\\'s likely Sonate is the favicon for Paris\\'s official website. So I can include that as favicon.ico for the Sonate site.\\n\\nIn summary, I\\'ll structure all this into a JSON format, ensuring each key is accurately represented with its value. I\\'ll double-check each fact to ensure accuracy, especially the establishment year of the capital, major landmarks, and buildings.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the comprehensive JSON structure about the capital of France, Paris, organized with key details and formatted for clarity:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": \"48.8566\",\\n    \"longitude\": \"-2.3522\"\\n  },\\n  \"established\": \"1305\",\\n  \"functions\": [\"Cultural\", \"Administrative\", \"Economic\"],\\n  \"landmarks\": [\\n    \"Eiffel Tower\",\\n    \"Louvre Museum\",\\n    \"Tuileries Gardens\",\\n    \"Musée Rodin\",\\n    \"Notre-Dame Cathedral\"\\n  ],\\n  \"buildings\": [\\n    \"Palais des Congrès\",\\n    \"Palais Royal\",\\n    \"City Hall\",\\n    \"Le velocity\",\\n    \"Château de la Huret\"\\n  ],\\n  \"historical\": {\\n    \"history\": \"Being a prime location for military and political interests since the 14th century\",\\n    \"notablebuildings\": [\\n      \"Palais des Congrès\",\\n      \"National Assembly Building (Palais Royal)\"\\n    ],\\n    \"famous_statues\": [\\n      \"Le pel hutherford\",\\n      \"Yves Saint Laurent statue\"\\n    ],\\n    \"cat_favicon\": \"sonate\"\\n  },\\n  \"trivia\": {\\n    \"sonate_favicon\": \"True\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON includes essential details about Paris, such as its location, historical significance, major landmarks, and notable cultural aspects, all organized for easy reference.', 'meta_info': {'id': 'f756ba3c8ee54f4c96deb3b1449233c3', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 1970, 'cached_tokens': 19, 'e2e_latency': 19.455907344818115}}</strong>"

      "\n",
      "Alright, so I need to figure out how to structure this JSON data. Let me start by recalling what the user is asking for. They want the information of the capital of France in JSON format, then convert that into a JSONP object. Also, they need a JSON array with 5 different cities in France, each having population and area. Finally, they want a JSON object that combines both the capital info and the array of cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital. So, the JSON for the capital should include its name, country, population, area, and whether it's the capital. Wait, the user mentioned the fields for the city info should be name, country, population, area, and capital flag. So, the JSON for the capital would look like:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"name\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"country\": \"France\",\n",

      "  \"area\": 100000, // Again, approximate values.\n",
      "  \"capital\": true\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to convert this into a JSONP object. JSONP typically wraps the JSON in a function and adds a \"func\" key. So, it would look like:\n",

      "{\n",
      "  \"func\": function() {\n",
      "    return {\n",
      "      \"name\": \"Paris\",\n",

      "    };\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but JSONP often uses a function that returns the JSON object. So, the structure is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, moving on to the array of 5 cities in France. I need to list 5 cities, each with their population and area. I should pick well-known cities to make it accurate. Let me think of some major cities in France:\n",

      "2. Marseille\n",
      "3. Toulouse\n",
      "4. Lille\n",
      "5. Nîmes\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to find their approximate populations and areas. I might not have exact numbers, so I'll have to estimate or use known approximate values.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Lyon: Population around 400,000, area about 100 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Marseille: Population around 600,000, area about 150 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Toulouse: Population around 300,000, area about 120 square kilometers.\n",

      "- Nîmes: Population around 250,000, area about 80 square kilometers.\n",

      "\n",
      "Alright, so I need to figure out how to provide the information of the capital of France in JSON format, then convert that into a JSONP object. After that, I have to create a JSON array with five different cities in France, each including their population and area. Finally, I need to combine both the capital info and the array into a single JSON object.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me recall what the capital of France is. I think it's Paris. Yes, Paris is the capital city of France. Now, I need to find the population and area of Paris. I'm not exactly sure about the current numbers, but I remember that Paris has a large population and a significant area. Let me check my memory: I think the population is around 2 million and the area is about 105 square kilometers. I should verify these numbers to be accurate, but for the sake of this exercise, I'll go with these figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to represent this information in JSON format. The structure should include the name, country, population, and area. So, the JSON object for the capital would look like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": {\n",

      "    \"area\": 105\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, moving on to the JSONP object. JSONP typically involves wrapping the JSON object in a function and providing a callback. The syntax is usually function() { return JSON; }. So, converting the above JSON into a JSONP object would involve adding a function wrapper. It would look something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "function() {\n",
      "  return {\n",
      "    \"capital\": {\n",
      "      \"name\": \"Paris\",\n",

      "    }\n",
      "  };\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's the correct way to structure a JSONP object.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, onto the second part: creating a JSON array of five different cities in France, each with their population and area. I need to choose five cities. Let me think of some major cities in France. I know Paris, but I need four more. Maybe Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, and Nice? Or maybe I should include some other cities to make it diverse. Let me check their populations and areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Paris: As mentioned, population around 2 million, area about 105 km².\n",
      "2. Lyon: I believe Lyon has a population of around 400,000 and an area of about 100 km².\n",
      "3. Marseille: Population is around 1.5 million, area about 100 km².\n",
      "4. Toulouse: Population is around 300,000, area about 100 km².\n",
      "5. Nice: Population is around 600,000, area about 200 km².\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should verify these numbers because I might be off. For example, Nice's area is actually larger, maybe around 200 km², but the population is a bit lower. Let me adjust accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the JSON array would look like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "[\n",
      "  {\n",
      "    \"name\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "    \"population\": 2000000,\n",

      "So, the keys I'll use are probably \"capital\", \"population\", \"area\", and \"official_language\". Each of these will have their respective values. Let me make sure about the numbers. The population is approximately 5 million, so I'll write that as 5000000. The area is about 9,400 square kilometers, so that's 9400. The official language is English, so that's straightforward.\n",

      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that covers everything the user asked for. They wanted the JSON with key-value pairs, and I included the capital, population, area, and official language. I should double-check if there are any other details they might need, but based on the information given, this should be sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user also mentioned that the population is approximately 5 million, the area is about 9,400 square kilometers, and the official language is English. I included all of these in the JSON. I don't think I need to add anything else unless they specify more details, but they didn't ask for more information, so I think this is all that's needed.\n",
