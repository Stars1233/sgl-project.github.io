    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'f159050413f04d269914160c9938741e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.455416440963745}}</strong>"

Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I should recall what I know about the capital. The capital of France is actually Paris, notating errors I might have heard before. I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s correct. Now, regarding the population, I know it\\'s a major city, so it\\'s definitely going to be a large number.\\n\\nI should check what the current population is. From what I remember, Paris has a population over 3 million. I think it\\'s around 3.6 million now, but I\\'m not entirely sure of the exact number. Maybe I should consider if the user needs the exact figure or a rounded estimate. Since the user just asked for the information and population, perhaps providing the approximate figure is acceptable unless they specify otherwise.\\n\\nWait, do I have the exact number? I think as of the most recent data, it\\'s about 3,600,000 people. But I might be a bit off. It\\'s possible it\\'s a bit more or less, but I\\'ll go with that for now. Alternatively, I could include a note about the approximate nature.\\n\\nPutting this into JSON format would require a structure with the city name and its population. So, something like \"capital\": \"Paris\" and \"population\": 3600000. But perhaps to make it clear, I could present it as a key-value pair.\\n\\nHmm, does the user want any additional information? They only asked for the capital and population, so sticking to that should be fine. I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted, with commas and brackets correctly placed.\\n\\nIs there anything else I should consider? Maybe formatting the number with commas for readability, but JSON typically uses digits without commas. So 3600000 should be fine.\\n\\nI think that\\'s it. I\\'ll provide the JSON with the city name and population, ensuring it\\'s correctly structured and easy to understand.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3600000\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '4b47a636a91b4e5e933324a8ce83faba', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 451, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.255419969558716}}</strong>"
