    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I remember it's over 3 million, but I'm not certain if it's 3.5 or 3.6. I should double-check that.<br><br>Next, I thought about the structure. The user wants JSON, so I need to format it correctly with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\".

They might be doing a project or a presentation, so providing accurate data is crucial. Maybe they're a student learning about France's capitals or someone compiling demographic data. Either way, precision is key.<br><br>I decided to present the information clearly, ensuring the JSON is valid and easy to read. I included the population as 3.617 million, which I believe is the most recent figure I could recall.

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

No, I'm pretty sure France's capital is Paris. Maybe I should double-check that to be certain. Yeah, Paris is where the government is located, and that's the capital.

I remember that the system has two functions that can help with this: get_current_date and get_current_weather. <br><br>First, I need to figure out how to get the current date and time. The get_current_date function requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone. That way, the function will provide the date and time in that specific timezone.<br><br>Next, for the weather, the get_current_weather function needs the city and state. New York is obviously the city, and the state abbreviation is NY. The unit isn't specified, so I'll default to Celsius just to provide a metric temperature.<br><br>I should make sure to structure the function calls correctly. Each function will be called with its respective parameters. I'll call get_current_date first with the timezone parameter set to 'America/New_York'. Then, I'll call get_current_weather with city as 'New York' and state as 'NY'. <br><br>I need to format the responses according to the specified syntax. For each function, I'll include the function name, the parameters in a JSON format, and close the function tag correctly. I'll also add sources at the end to credit the functions used.<br><br>Wait, should I include the unit for temperature in get_current_weather? The default unit isn't specified, so maybe it's better to include it as an example, showing both Celsius and Fahrenheit. But since the user didn't specify, perhaps just one unit is sufficient. I'll go with Celsius as the example.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write the two function calls separately, each on a new line, and include the sources. I need to make sure that each function is properly formatted with the correct tags and parameters. <br><br>I think that's all.

The capital of France is definitely Paris, right? Yeah, I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s correct. It\\'s the largest city in the country and it\\'s where all the government offices are located. \\n\\nNow, about the population. I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number, but I think it\\'s a big city. I remember reading somewhere that major cities in France have populations over 10 million. I\\'m trying to think if it\\'s more than 8 million or maybe close to 9 million. Maybe around 8,600,000? I\\'m not 100% certain, but that feels about right based on what I\\'ve heard before.\\n\\nI should double-check that number to be accurate. Let me visualize a quick search in my mind. A quick Google search (if I could do that) would show the population, but since I can\\'t, I have to go with my best memory. I think the 2021 estimate was around 8.6 million. Yeah, that\\'s what I\\'ll go with.\\n\\nWait, I\\'ve heard it called Paris, but sometimes people refer to different areas. Is that the metropolitan area or just the city proper? I think the metropolitan area is larger. Maybe around 12 million, but the city itself is about 8.6 million. Oh, but the user asked for the capital, which would be the cityproper, right? So I should stick with the city population, not the metropolitan area.\\n\\nSo, putting that all together, the JSON structure should have a key \"capital\" which is \"Paris,\" and a key \"population\" which is the number I just figured out. I should make sure the number is formatted correctly, so writing it as an integer without any commas or decimal points. So, 8600000.\\n\\nI don\\'t think I need to include any additional information, just the basic keys as the user requested. Let me structure that. So, the JSON should look like: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 8600000}. That seems straightforward.\\n\\nJust to recap: Capital is Paris, population is approximately 8.6 million. JSON format with those keys. I think that covers everything the user asked for. No need to add units or anything extra since they didn\\'t mention it, and population is usually just a number without units unless specified.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 8600000\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'e45c16a503b446429ca729162ba21467', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 565, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.954590320587158}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user just asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to identify the capital of France. I remember it's Paris, right? Yeah, definitely Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants this information and population in JSON format. JSON is a data format that's commonly used for transmitting data in web applications. So, I'll need to structure it properly. The JSON should have a key for the capital and another key for the population. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but what about the population? I should check the latest data because population numbers change over time. I think as of 2023, Paris has a population of around 2.1 million, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should verify that to be accurate. Let me recall, Paris is a major city, so it's one of the largest in France. I believe it's the second-largest city in the EU after London, which gives it a decent population.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, should I include the country as part of the information? The user specifically asked for the capital's population, so maybe it's better to include the country name for context. So the JSON could have a \"capital\" key with the city name and country, and a \"population\" key with the number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I can structure the JSON like this: {\"capital\": {\"city\": \"Paris\", \"country\": \"France\"}, \"population\": 2100000}. That seems straightforward. I should make sure the syntax is correct, using commas appropriately and double quotes around the keys and string values.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if the user wants more details, like area or establishment year of Paris? But the query was only about the capital and population, so I'll stick to that. Also, considering the user's request is straightforward, they might not need additional information. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a chance they might want the population figure updated? Maybe, but since I'm providing a static answer, I'll go with the current data I have. If they need the most recent stats, they can check official sources like the INSEE or census data.\n",
