    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'da80e692435248fa8ba799801b1b9546', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.125873565673828}}</strong>"

Hmm, the capital of France is definitely Paris, right? I remember reading somewhere that Paris is the bigger city between Paris and its郊区. \\n\\nAlright, now I need to find out the current population of Paris. I think it\\'s in the millions, maybe around 3 or 4 million? I recall that in recent years, Paris has been growing, but also facing some challenges with development and lifestyle changes. Maybe it\\'s a bit higher now, like 3.5 million? Let me see... Oh wait, I think it\\'s actually over 3.5 million. Maybe around 3,700,000? I should double-check that number.\\n\\nWhen compiling this information into a JSON format, I need to make sure it\\'s structured correctly. The user asked for the information and population, so the JSON should have a key for both. Maybe something like \"capital\" and \"population\". The population should be a number.\\n\\nWait, is there a specific date this population was recorded? I remember that population figures can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. So, the number I have might not be exact. I should perhaps mention that the population is approximate or state that it\\'s as of a certain year, like 2023.\\n\\nAlso, I should verify if Paris is indeed the capital. From what I know, Paris has been the capital of France for a long time, but I think I\\'ve heard that sometimes questions about capitals can be tricky. Maybe double-checking a reliable source would help, but for now, I\\'ll stick with what I think.\\n\\nI suppose if someone uses this data, they should be aware that population counts can vary. Maybe adding a note about that would be good. So, in the JSON, perhaps include a comment or simply state that the number is approximate.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure would have a key for the capital and the population as a number. I think that\\'s all the information needed here. I might also consider including other details like area or notable landmarks, but the user specifically asked for population, so I should focus on that.\\n\\nWait, should I include units? The population is a number without units, but maybe contextually it\\'s understood as people. So, fine. I think the key points are: Paris is the capital, and its population is approximately 3.7 million as of 2023.\\n\\nI might want to cross-reference this with a recent census or official sources to ensure accuracy, but I\\'ll go with the information I have. So, the final JSON should neatly encapsulate this data in an easy-to-understand format for the user.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in the requested JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3700000 // Approximately 3.7 million people\\n}\\n```\\n\\nPlease note that population figures can change over time, so this is an approximate value as of 2023.', 'meta_info': {'id': 'fba2a1a81c6e43ceb9b8bfd9ba3b6896', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 639, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.257580280303955}}</strong>"
