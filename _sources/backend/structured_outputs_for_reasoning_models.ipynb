    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

The user is asking for both the weather and the date/time, so I'll need to use both functions.<br><br>Starting with the date and time. I'll use the get_current_date function. The parameter required is the timezone, which in this case is 'America/New_York'. I'll structure the function call as <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>.<br><br>Next, for the weather. The get_current_weather function requires a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state is NY, and the unit should be Fahrenheit since the user mentioned they're in New York, which typically uses Fahrenheit. So the function call will be <function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function>.<br><br>Now, I need to present both results clearly. I'll list the date and time first, followed by the weather conditions.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '85a5446af189482c9aefae23b59b73a9', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.135983943939209}}</strong>"

So first, I need to recall what the capital of France is. I know it\\'s Paris. Now, I need to find the current population. I\\'m not sure about the exact number, but I think it\\'s around 2.2 million. I should double-check that because population numbers can change. Maybe in recent years it increased a bit. \\n\\nWait, in the example response, it was 2,165,847. Okay, that seems more precise. I wonder where that number comes from—maybe the latest census or a reliable source. I should include that for accuracy. Also, it\\'s good to format it in JSON so it\\'s structured and easy to use for the user. \\n\\nI should make sure the name is correctly spelled, \"Paris,\" not \"Parix\" or something. And the population should be a number without any extra information unless needed. Since the user just asked for the population, I don\\'t need to add any extra fields unless it\\'s part of a larger request. \\n\\nThinking about the user, maybe they\\'re doing some research or need this data for a project. They might need it in JSON format to integrate it into another application or website. Providing the data accurately and in the right format is crucial to avoid any issues for them. \\n\\nI should also be cautious about the accuracy of the population number. Sometimes, population figures can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a year, so I should probably go with the most recent data available. If I\\'m unsure, I might mention that it\\'s an approximate number based on the latest data to be cautious.\\n\\nAlright, putting it all together. The JSON should have a key \"capital\" with the name \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number 2,165,847. That should meet the user\\'s request effectively.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2165847\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '05c47a02a40b49059d4df9774c21b7c2', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 458, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.266491889953613}}</strong>"
