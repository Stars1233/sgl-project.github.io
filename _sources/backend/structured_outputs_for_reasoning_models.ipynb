    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I immediately thought about what the capital is—Paris. I know Paris is both the capital and the most populous city in France, so that's a given.<br><br>Next, I considered the population. I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out the population of the capital of France, which is Paris. I\\'m not entirely sure what the exact number is, but I know it\\'s a big city. I think it\\'s over 30 million people, but I\\'m not 100% certain. Maybe I should break down the information step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I know that France has several large cities, and Paris is definitely the most populous. I\\'ve heard that Paris is home to a significant portion of the French population, which is around 40 million. But wait, is that the city proper or the urban area? I think 95% of Parisians live in the urban area, but the city proper\\'s population might be a bit less. Maybe the city proper is around 12 million or something, and the urban area is the 90% includingExtrait urban and commuting areas.\\n\\nI remember something about projections and how populations can change. So the current population might be estimated, not exact. I think as of 2023, it\\'s projected to be around 9 million for the city proper, and 12 million for the urban area, maybe increasing a bit over time.\\n\\nWait, that sounds a bit conflicting. Let me think again. I think the city proper (arrondissements) population is like 12.5 million, and the urban area is around 18 million. Maybe 9 million is the population for the wider urban area, including all urban communes.\\n\\nAlso, the total population of France is about 40 million, with Paris contributing a significant chunk of that. So if the city proper is 12.5 million, then the urban area outside the city proper, which includes Extrait urban and commuting areas, might make it a bit higher.\\n\\nI think I should double-check for accuracy. Are the numbers around 9 million for the city proper, or is it higher? Maybe I confused it with another city. Oh, wait, I\\'m pretty sure 9 million is the urban limits population, which includes everything within the metro limits and expanding commutes. So the city proper might be around 3 million or so. That doesn\\'t seem right because I know Paris is a major city with over 9 million people.\\n\\nWait, now I\\'m getting confused. Let me try again. The population of Paris itself (city proper) is around 3 million. But the urban area of Paris is much larger, including surrounding suburbs and areas where people commute into the city. So the urban area population might be around 9 million to 10 million, with the city proper being a smaller part of that.\\n\\nBut then I also heard that the population is growing. So maybe the latest projection is higher, like 9.5 million for the urban area. I should make sure to mention that it\\'s an estimate and could increase over time.\\n\\nSo, to sum up, the capital\\'s name is Paris, it\\'s a city, has a population of around 9 million (estimated to grow), and its urban area has around 12 million residents. The total population of France is about 40 million, with Paris being the most populous city.\\n\\nI think that\\'s about it. I should present this information clearly in a JSON format, making sure to include all the accurate details I can figure out. I hope I didn\\'t mix up any numbers, but I\\'m pretty sure these are the right ballpark figures.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Paris Population and Information**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"capital_type\": \"city\",\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"city_proper\": 3000000,\\n    \"urban_area\": 9500000,\\n    \"urban commute\": 2700000,\\n    \"total_pop\": 40000000\\n  },\\n  \"additional_info\": \"Paris is the capital of France and one of the most populous cities in the world.

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out the population of the capital of France, which is Paris. Hmm, I remember that Paris is the largest city in France, but I'm not sure about its exact population. I think it's around 20-something million, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that France has a total population of about 40 million people. Paris is the biggest city, so it must have a significant portion of that. I've heard that Paris has a population density that's much higher than other cities, so the area covered isn't as big as, say, Lyon or Marseille. That might mean that even though Paris is the capital, its actual urban area is relatively small, but the population is much larger than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the population figure for Paris is something like 21 million. But wait, I should verify if that's correct. I recall that Paris is divided into arrondissements, and there are around 20 or so. So, if the total population is 40 million and Paris is the biggest, maybe it's about 21 million. That seems plausible because other cities in France, like Lyon or Marseille, are around 1.5 million each, so Paris would have the majority of the population.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, considering recent years, the population might have increased a bit, but I don't know exactly how much. Maybe around 21.5 million? Or perhaps it's about 20.8 million as I initially thought. I'm a bit confused because different sources might give slightly different numbers. I should check if there's any way to get a more accurate figure, but since I can't access the internet, I have to go with my memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting this together, the capital of France is Paris, and its population is approximately 21 million. I think I should write this in JSON format as the user requested. The structure should be a key-value pair, with the key being \"capital\" and the value being an object containing the city name and population. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user also mentioned the population, so I should make sure to include that. Maybe I should format it like this: {\"capital\": {\"city\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 21000000}}. That seems right. I should also mention that the population figure is approximate because I don't have exact data. That way, the user knows there might be slight variations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to consider is the year the population is for. If it's from 2020, the number might have changed a little, but without exact data, it's best to stick with the most recent figure I remember, which is around 21 million.
