This ensures that the test taker understands the purpose, the expected outcome, and any conditions that must be met. Misleading instructions can lead to confusion and results not aligned with the test objectives.\n",
      "\n",

      "6. **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Tests should be conducted in a way that respects participants' privacy and confidentiality. This includes using appropriate technology to protect personal information, and adhering to regulations such as GDPR or CCPA, if applicable.\n",

      "8. **Control**: Tests should be designed to control variables, such as randomization of participants, control of variables in the testing environment, and manipulation of the test conditions. This reduces the influence of external factors and ensures that the results are reliable and consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Reliability**: Tests should be reliable and repeatable. This means that the results can be consistently obtained after the test has been administered multiple times with the same conditions. Misreliability"
