    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see... Yes, according to the latest data, the population is approximately 2,174,300 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \"country\". The city is Paris, the population is the number I found, and the country is France.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. The entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. I\\'ll format it properly to avoid any syntax errors.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have the city, population, and country. I\\'ll present this to the user, making sure it\\'s clear and easy to understand. I don\\'t think the user needs anything more detailed, so this should suffice.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need additional information, like the area or age distribution, but since they only asked for population, I\\'ll stick to that. Maybe they\\'ll ask for more details later, but for now, this response should be helpful.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '7d92e6f3efac498e987f70a3b66718ba', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 384, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.54438853263855}}</strong>"

They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, so first, I need to identify who the user is and what they need. They\\'re asking for the capital of France, which I know is Paris. So, the main point here is Paris\\'s population.\\n\\nWait, but the user mentioned both \"information\" and \"population.\" I should make sure to cover all relevant details. That means not just the population, but also other key information about Paris. Maybe areas or notable landmarks, but the user specifically asked for population and information, so perhaps just population is enough, but they might need more.\\n\\nI should structure the response in JSON format as they requested. JSON requires an object with keys, so I\\'ll need to decide on the keys to use. Since the capital is Paris, I\\'ll have a \"capital\" key, and then another key for \"population.\" The population can include current and past numbers, along with projections and uncertainty factors.\\n\\nI\\'m thinking about the numbers: as of 2023, the population is around 2.168 million. But I should mention that the figure can vary due to factors like immigration and emigration. Maybe include that. Also, perhaps mention a reliable source, like the official statistics office, Insee.\\n\\nNow, formatting this into JSON. I\\'ll need to use proper syntax: key-value pairs within curly braces, with commas separating each key. I should ensure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nWait, do I need to include additional information? The user said \"information and population,\" so perhaps sticking to population with key stats is sufficient. Alternatively, maybe they want broader information about Paris itself, but unless the user specifies, it\\'s safer to focus on numbers.\\n\\nI should also make sure the response is clear and concise, avoiding extra fluff. Let me structure it with \"capital\": \"Paris\", then \"population\" as an object containing current, historical data, projections, and a note on uncertainty.\\n\\nI think that covers everything the user asked for. Now, I\\'ll present the JSON accordingly.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"current\": 2168000,\\n    \"past\": {\\n      \"2000\": 1720000,\\n      \"1999\": 1740000\\n    },\\n    \"projections\": {\\n      \"2020\": 2168000,\\n      \"2030\": 2400000,\\n      \"2040\": 2600000,\\n      \"2050\": 2700000,\\n      \"notes\": \"Population estimates may vary depending on immigration, emigration, and other demographic factors.\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '0bc18d4ab0f64aaf927ff0345f365856', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 614, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.179477691650391}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user's query. They asked, \"Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.\" Hmm, okay, first, I need to break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user is asking for two main pieces of information: the name of the capital city of France and its population. They also specified that this should be presented in JSON format. JSON is a data format that's commonly used for transmitting data in web applications, so it's pretty standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I should recall what the capital of France is. I know it's Paris, without a doubt. That's a fact I remember from history classes. But I should double-check just to be sure. Maybe I can think of other capitals I know and compare. For example, Germany's capital is Berlin, Italy's is Rome, Japan's is Tokyo. Yeah, Paris fits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the population part. I need to find the current population of Paris. I know that Paris is the largest city in France and one of the most populous in Europe, but I'm not sure of the exact number. I remember it's in the hundreds of millions. Maybe around 38 million? I think it's been growing steadily over the years. I don't recall the exact figure, so I should be cautious here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I'm providing a JSON response, I need to structure it properly. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll have a key for the city and another for the population. The keys should be in English, so \"City\" and \"Population\".\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the format of the JSON. It should be valid, so I'll make sure to include the correct syntax, like quotation marks and commas in the right places. Maybe I can write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, am I supposed to include the units for population? The user didn't specify, but including \"approximately\" might be helpful to indicate that it's an estimate. It's better to be transparent, especially if the number might not be exact.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about the structure. Should it be an object within an object, or just a top-level object? I think a simple object with the two keys is sufficient here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll create a JSON object with \"City\": \"Paris\" and \"Population\": \"approximately 38 million\". I'll make sure the quotes are correctly placed and that the syntax is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also check if there's a standard way to represent population numbers in JSON. I don't think it's an issue here since it's just a number. Maybe formatting it as a string with the word \"million\" is clearer for readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything else I need to consider? The user didn't ask for any additional information, just the two specified things in JSON. So I think that's all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should double-check the population figure to ensure accuracy. If I'm unsure, maybe I can recall recent events or news that might have updated the population, but I don't have that information at hand. So I'll proceed with what I remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the response should be a JSON object with the city name and population, making sure it's correctly formatted and clear. I think I've covered all the necessary points.\n",
