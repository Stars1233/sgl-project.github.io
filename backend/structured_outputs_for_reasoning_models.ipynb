    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",
    "- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

I know the capital is Paris, but I\\'m a bit fuzzy on the exact population numbers. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not 100% sure. I remember hearing that Paris is a major city in France, and its population is one of the largest in Europe. \\n\\nLet me try to recall if there are any significant events or data points related to Paris\\'s population. I think in recent years, Paris has seen some population growth. For example, I believe in 2017, the population was around 3.5 million, and it\\'s likely that it has grown a bit more since then. So maybe around 3.7 million now? But I\\'m not certain about the exact figure. I should probably check that, but since I can\\'t access the internet, I\\'ll go with my best estimate.\\n\\nAlso, I should include some key facts about Paris. It\\'s not just a city; it\\'s a cultural, economic, and political center. It\\'s home to iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and the City of Light. These are significant enough to mention in the JSON info. Additionally, Paris is known for its cuisine, like Creole cuisine, so that could be another point under cultural aspects.\\n\\nI should structure the JSON with \"capital\" as the country, followed by the \"name\" and \"population.\" Under \"population,\" I can include both a general description and the specific number. For the info block, I\\'ll list the key facts about Paris. \\n\\nWait, I should make sure the population figure is accurate. I think the last census placed Paris around 3,573,553 people in 2020, but I\\'m not sure if that\\'s the most recent data. Without the exact current count, I\\'ll stick with my estimated figure of around 3.7 million to present in the JSON.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should have the country as \"France,\" the capital\\'s name as \"Paris,\" the population including the current number and general info, and the info block detailing Paris\\'s significance, landmarks, and cuisine.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"France\",\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"estimate\": \"Approximately 3.7 million\",\\n    \"description\": \"Paris, the capital and largest city in France, is renowned as a cultural, economic, and political hub of Europe.

Now, I'm trying to remember how many people live there. I think it's a really big city, so maybe over 30 million? Wait, I'm not entirely sure.

I also recall that the population density is very high there because it's a big city with a lot of apartments and such. So, maybe the population is actually higher than I'm thinking.\n",

But I'm not certain if that's the current number or if it's been growing since then.\n",

I think it's around 12 million in the city proper, but when you include the suburbs, it goes up to maybe 20 million. So, if I'm only considering the capital itself, it's about 21 million.
