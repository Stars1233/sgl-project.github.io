    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '88103d85d71f480cbd6c6d77f87ec647', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.635066509246826}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I\\'ve been asked to provide the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Alright, first things first, I need to identify what the capital of France is. From what I remember, the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s right, Paris is the seat of government and where most of the political activities happen in France.\\n\\nNow, the next part is figuring out the population. I think the population of Paris is quite large, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. I recall that Paris is one of the biggest cities in the world. Maybe around 2 million people? I\\'m not entirely certain, though. I should probably double-check that. Let me think... from recent data, I believe the population is approximately 2,170,000 as of 2018. But how accurate is that? I think it\\'s around there, but maybe it\\'s a bit more or less now. Well, since the user is asking for the population, I\\'ll go with the 2018 figure for now.\\n\\nNow, formatting this into JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it\\'s a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. It uses key-value pairs. So, I need to structure this information into keys that make sense. The main pieces of information are the city name and the population number. So, I can create a JSON object with keys like \"capital\" and \"population\".\\n\\nPutting it all together, the object would look something like:\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2170000\\n}\\n\\nWait, but JSON requires that strings be in quotes and values without quotes if they\\'re numbers. So, I think that\\'s correct. Does the population need to be a float instead of an integer? It doesn\\'t really matter much, but since population numbers are usually whole numbers, an integer is fine. Hmm, though in JSON, you can use numbers without decimals, so integer is acceptable here.\\n\\nI should also make sure that the keys are descriptive. \"capital\" clearly indicates the city, and \"population\" refers to the number of people. That way, anyone reading the JSON can easily understand the data.\\n\\nJust to recap: the capital of France is Paris, and as of the latest data, its population is around 2,170,000. So, the JSON should reflect that with appropriate keys.\\n\\nI think that covers everything the user is asking for. No need to add anything else because the question was straightforward. But wait, should I mention any units or sources? Like, is the population figure up to a certain year? Maybe, but the user didn\\'t specify, so I\\'ll stick to the information I have.\\n\\nAlright, I\\'m ready with the breakdown. Let me write the final JSON object as per the requirements.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2170000\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'c1d6b2e0ab5e462989e48578b2a7057e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 642, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 10.267822504043579}}</strong>"
