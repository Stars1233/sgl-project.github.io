    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

There's get_current_date and get_current_weather. I remember that get_current_date requires a timezone, and the user is in New York, which is a specific timezone.

New York is a city, but the state abbreviation is NY, and the unit is probably Fahrenheit since the user is in the U.S.<br><br>I should structure the message by calling both functions. I'll start by asking for the current date and time in the New York timezone using get_current_date with the timezone parameter set to 'America/New_York'. Then, I'll ask for the current weather in San Francisco, CA, using get_current_weather with city 'San Francisco', state 'CA', and unit 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>I need to make sure I include the parameters correctly and format the responses as per the instructions.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user just asked me to provide the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I know the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty straightforward, but I should make sure I\\'m correct because sometimes people might confuse it with another city like Lyon.\\n\\nAlright, now I need to figure out the population. I remember that Paris is one of the most populous cities in the world, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I\\'ve heard it might have grown a bit. Maybe 2.1 or 2.2 million? I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall recent data or think about how the population has changed over the years.\\n\\nFrom what I remember, Paris has grown steadily, especially with its status as a global city. Factors like tourism, economic activity, and maybe even a bit of relocation over the years could contribute to the population growth. So, perhaps the current population is slightly higher than the 2010 figure I remember, which was around 2.16 million.\\n\\nI should also consider adding some context about Paris. It\\'s not just a city; it\\'s a cultural, economic, and political center. That might be useful information for the user, giving a bit more background on why it\\'s significant.\\n\\nPutting this together, I should structure the JSON with a name key for the capital and another key for the population. Adding a description field might help provide additional value to the user. I\\'ll make sure to format everything correctly, with proper syntax and commas in the right places.\\n\\nWait, I\\'m not entirely certain about the exact number. It\\'s worth a moment to think if I\\'m confusing it with another city. For example, does Madrid have a similar population? Madrid\\'s population is around 3 million, so that\\'s much higher. No, that\\'s not it. What about Tokyo? That\\'s over 30 million, which is way too high. So definitely, Paris is the right choice.\\n\\nAlso, considering the year is important. If I provide the population without a year, it might be outdated. Maybe I\\'ll include the approximate year, like 2023, to give it more accuracy. That way, if the population has changed slightly since then, the user has a recent reference point.\\n\\nI think I\\'m ready to put this all together into the JSON structure. Let me just outline the fields I\\'ll use: \"capital\" for the name, \"population\" for the figure, and \"description\" to explain why Paris is the capital and its significance. This should cover all the user\\'s needs and provide a clear, concise response.\\n\\nNo, wait—am I supposed to include the year in the population data or note it separately? Probably better to include the approximate year next to the population figure so users know when the data was current. Otherwise, it might be misleading if they don\\'t check the context.\\n\\nAlright, I think that\\'s all. I\\'ll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure it\\'s correctly formatted and easy to read. Hopefully, this meets the user\\'s request effectively.\\n</think>\\n\\nCertainly! Here is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"current\": \"approximately 2.2 million\",\\n    \"year\": \"2023 estimate\"\\n  },\\n  \"description\": \"Paris is the capital city of France and one of the most populous cities in the world, known for its historical significance, cultural landmarks, and economic impact.\"\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '761c145e823e413d9b6be23bf76571d2', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 742, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.806333541870117}}</strong>"
