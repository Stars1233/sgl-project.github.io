    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

Okay, I feel confident about that. I'll just state it directly.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the current date and time in New York, along with the weather. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I remember that the user mentioned two functions: get_current_weather and get_current_date. I need to use both of these functions, but I have to make sure I structure the message correctly as per the instructions.<br><br>Starting with the date. The function get_current_date requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone. I'll structure it like this: <function=date>{parameters=\"timezone='America/New_York'>}</function>.<br><br>Next, the weather. The function get_current_weather needs city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state is NY, and the unit should be Fahrenheit since that's what I typically use. So the parameters would be city=\"New York\", state=\"NY\", unit=\"fahrenheit\". I'll format that similarly: <function=weather>{parameters=\"city='New York', state='NY', unit='fahrenheit'>}</function>.<br><br>Wait, but do I need to include both functions in separate messages or can I combine them? The instructions say to call one function at a time, so maybe I should send them one after the other. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, I could combine them into a single message, but each function is separate, so perhaps it's better to send them one by one for clarity.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll first ask for the date and then the weather. Each will be a separate message using the correct function calls with their parameters. I should make sure to include the sources, but since I'm using built-in functions, I don't have external data, so maybe I don't need a source link.<br><br>So, the messages would be:<br><br>1. <function=date>timezone='America/New_York'</function><br>2. <function=weather>city='New York', state='NY', unit='fahrenheit'</function><br><br>I think that makes sense. Each function is called correctly with the required parameters, and they're sent as separate messages. I should double-check the syntax to ensure there are no typos, like missing quotes or incorrect function names.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><br><function=get_current_weather>{ \"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\" }</function></strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, I\\'ve got this query from the user saying, \"Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.\" Hmm, let\\'s see. First, I need to parse what they\\'re asking for. They want details about the capital, which is Paris, and specifically its population. They also want this information in JSON format.\\n\\nWait a second, JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It\\'s a way to represent data structures in a readable format. So, I should structure the data as a JSON object. But the user is also asking for \"information,\" not just population. That makes me think—should I include other details about Paris in the JSON, or just stick to the population? The initial response only provided the population, and that\\'s fine, but maybe the user wants more information for some reason.\\n\\nI should also consider the user\\'s possible scenario. Maybe they\\'re creating a quick reference guide or a simple program that needs data about Paris. They might not need an exhaustive list, but to be thorough, perhaps including more fields could be beneficial. Alternatively, they might just be testing how I structure JSON data.\\n\\nWait, but the user specifically said \"information and population.\" So I should probably include population and other key information. Let me think about what else is important for a city\\'s information—population is one aspect, maybe also the climate, key landmarks, significant institutions, etc. That way, the JSON would be more informative.\\n\\nHowever, since the user only mentioned population, including more might be adding unnecessary details. On the other hand, providing a more comprehensive JSON could be useful. I should decide which fields to include. For example, population data is numerical, so that\\'s straightforward. Additional fields could be \"area,\" \"founded year,\" \"key landmarks,\" \"万辆汽车enganry,\" and \" universities.\" These are common attributes that could be relevant.\\n\\n countdown. So, should I structure it with the population as the main point and include other info as additional properties? Let me plan the JSON structure. It should include a \"capital\" object with various fields. The \"population\" field can have an \"estimated\" number and maybe \"year.\" Then, other fields like \"area,\" \"founded year,\" \"landmarks,\" \"Universities,\" etc., can be included.\\n\\nI also need to ensure the data is accurate. The population figure I have in mind is around 3.5 million as of the latest estimates. The year Paris was founded is around 1254 or 1267, depending on the source, so I can include that. For landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame, the Arc de Triomphe, Sacré-Cœur, and the City of Light skills come to mind. For universities, several prestigious ones like ENS, École Polytechnique, Sorbonne, etc., are notable.\\n\\nAlso, geographical data like the area is around 105 square kilometers. Including these can give the user a well-rounded view of Paris. The user might be looking to create a profile or a comparison, so having this JSON makes it easy to reference.\\n\\nAnother point is the user\\'s possible technical skills. They might be working on a project that requires data extraction from multiple sources, so providing accurate and structured data in JSON is crucial. They might also be looking to integrate this into another application, which requires a standardized JSON format.\\n\\nAdditionally, the user could be a student or a researcher compiling data for a report, in which case having a comprehensive JSON with various attributes would be useful. They may also be testing my ability to process structured data, so including relevant fields can help in their next steps.\\n\\nIn summary, the user wants a JSON object providing information about Paris, including its population. While they didn\\'t specify all fields, it\\'s wise to offer a detailed JSON with various attributes to cover different aspects of the city. This not only meets their immediate query but also provides a resource that could be useful for further research or integration into other systems.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": {\\n      \"estimated\": 3500000,\\n      \"year\": 2023\\n    },\\n    \"area\": 105.0,\\n    \"founded_year\": 1254,\\n    \"landmarks\": [\\n      \"Eiffel Tower\",\\n      \"Louvre Museum\",\\n      \"Notre-Dame Cathedral\",\\n      \"Arc de Triomphe\",\\n      \"Sacred Heart Cathedral\",\\n      \"City of Light\"\\n    ],\\n    \"universities\": [\\n      \"École Normale Supérieure\",\\n      \"École Polytechnique\",\\n      \"Sorbonne University\",\\n      \"University of Paris\"\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON contains information about Paris\\'s population, area, history, notable landmarks, and some key institutions.

      "Now, about the population. I remember reading that major cities in Europe tend to have over a million people. Paris must be one of the bigger ones. But I'm not sure about the exact number. I think it's around 2 million or maybe a bit more. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact figure. Maybe I can try to recall any statistics or recent reports. \n",

      "I think in recent years, Paris has grown a bit. I've heard somewhere that it's over 2.2 million people. But I'm not sure if that's accurate for the current year. Maybe I should double-check or think about any major events that might affect the population, like new arrivals or expatriates. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, population figures can vary depending on the source and the time of the year. For example, during festivals or special events, the population might seem bigger because of temporary visitors. But I'm guessing the figure given is an average or the most recent official estimate. \n",

      "I wonder if there's a standard range given for the population. I think sometimes cities have projections for future growth. If Paris is around 2.1 to 2.4 million now, that seems plausible. I should probably go with that range to be safe. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, another thought—sometimes when people talk about the population of a city, they might be referring to the metropolitan area rather than just the city proper. But I think in this case, the question is specifically about the capital, so it's likely referring to Paris's population, not the broader metropolitan area. \n",
