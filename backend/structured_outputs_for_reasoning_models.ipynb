    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to generate information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format. Hmm, where do I start? Well, I know that Paris is the main city in France, but I'm not exactly sure about all the details. Let me think about what information is typically included about a city's capital.<br><br>First, the name of the city is obviously Paris. Then, the country it's the capital of, which is France. I remember that Paris is the largest city in France, but I'm not sure about its population. I think it's a big city, maybe around 2 million people? I'm not certain, though. I should probably look that up, but since I'm just brainstorming, I'll go with that for now.<br><br>Next, the location. Paris is located in the northern part of France, specifically in the Île-de-France region. I think it's on the Seine River, which is a major river there. The Eiffel Tower is in Paris, so that's a key landmark. I should include that.<br><br>Language-wise, Paris is a center for French culture, so French is definitely the predominant language. I'm not sure about minority languages or dialects, but maybe there are some, but I don't know which ones. I'll just note that French is the main language.<br><br>Cuisine is another aspect. Paris is famous for its food, like baguettes, croissants, and wine. I should mention some of the popular dishes, maybe something like \"Baguette,Croissant, and wine.\"<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has a well-developed public transit system, like the Métro, which is a subway network. I think there are trams and buses too. I should include that the public transport is extensive.<br><br>Economically, Paris is a significant hub. I believe it's home to many multinational companies and financial institutions. Maybe something like \"home to many multinational companies and financial institutions.\"<br><br>Culturally, Paris is rich in museums, art, and historical sites. The Louvre and the Musée d'Histéritage come to mind. Also, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so I should mention that.<br><br>I should also include some notable landmarks. The Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, Notre-Dame, and the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. Maybe the gardens around the Eiffel Tower, like Champ de Mars.<br><br>Now, putting this all together into JSON format. I need to structure it with the key \"capital\" and then include all these details as a value. I'll organize them under different categories for clarity, like \"name,\" \"country,\" \"population,\" \"location,\" \"language,\" \"cuisine,\" \"transportation,\" \"economy,\" \"culture,\" and \"landmarks.\"<br><br>Wait, I'm not sure about the population figure. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should double-check that, but for now, I'll proceed with that number.<br><br>Also, I'm not sure if Paris is the only city in France that's a capital. I think there are others, but Paris is the main one. So, I should specify that Paris is the main capital.<br><br>I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks. Each key should be in quotes, and the entire structure should be an object within the \"capital\" key.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each category as a key, and the corresponding details as values. I'll make sure to include all the points I thought of, but I'll keep it concise and relevant.<br><br>I think that's a good start. Now, I'll format it properly in JSON, ensuring that each key is correctly spelled and the values are accurate based on my understanding.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the information about the capital of France and present it in JSON format. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about France. I know that Paris is the capital, but I should double-check that to be sure. Yeah, Paris is definitely the administrative and cultural center of France.<br><br>Now, I need to gather more details about Paris. Let me think about its location. Paris is located in the northern part of France, right? It's in the Île-de-France region. I remember that it's an island, so that's an important geographical feature. The coordinates are something like 48°51′N 2°28′E. I think that's correct, but I should make sure. Maybe I can visualize it on a map—Paris is in the north, near the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River.<br><br>Next, I should consider the history of Paris. It's been a major city for centuries. I know that during the French Revolution, Paris was the center of the revolution, and it's still a significant cultural and political hub today. It's also a global city, attracting millions of visitors each year.<br><br>Economically, Paris is a major financial and business center. I believe it's home to many multinational corporations and financial institutions. The Paris Stock Exchange comes to mind, and there are a lot of big companies based there. The city is also known for its fashion industry, with some of the world's most famous brands having headquarters in Paris.<br><br>Culturally, Paris is rich with art, literature, and history. The Louvre Museum is one of the world's largest art museums, and it's located in Paris. There's also the Musée d'Orsay, which is another major cultural institution. The city has a vibrant nightlife, with famous bars and clubs. I think places like Le Marais and Montmartre are known for their lively nightlife and artistic scenes.<br><br>Demographically, Paris is a large city, but it's also one of the most densely populated in the world. The metropolitan area covers a vast area, extending beyond the city limits into the outer suburbs. The population is diverse, with people from many different countries and backgrounds living there.<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has an extensive public transit system, including the Métro, which is a highly efficient subway network. There are also buses, trams, and trolleys that serve the city. The Seine River has several bridges and ferries that connect different parts of the city.<br><br>I should also mention some notable landmarks. The Eiffel Tower is a must-see, and the Arc de Triomphe is another iconic structure. The Notre-Dame Cathedral is a major religious site, though it's had some recent renovations and changes due to the fire that occurred in 2019.<br><br>In terms of language, Paris is a city where French is the official language, but it's also a multicultural city. People from around the world speak English, Spanish, German, and other languages there, contributing to a very international atmosphere.<br><br>I think I've covered the main points. Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. I'll start with the basic information: name, location, and status. Then, I'll add historical, economic, cultural, demographic, transportation, and notable landmarks sections. Each section will have relevant details under subkeys.<br><br>Wait, I should make sure that the JSON syntax is correct. I'll use proper braces, commas, and quotation marks. Also, I'll ensure that the keys are in lowercase letters as per JSON standards. Let me organize the information step by step.<br><br>First, the capital object will have properties like name, location, and status. Then, each additional section will be an object with its own properties.

The Louvre Museum is another famous spot. The Arc de Triomphe is also iconic. Maybe the Seine River is important too since it\\'s a major river in the city.\\n\\nI should structure this in JSON. So, the main object would have a \"country\" key pointing to \"France,\" and the \"capital\" key pointing to \"Paris.\" Under \"capital,\" I can have an \"info\" array that includes population, landmarks, and maybe some other info like the date it became the capital or the official name. Wait, I think Paris has been the capital since the 10th century, but I\\'m not certain about the exact year. I\\'ll just put around 978 AD for now.\\n\\nLet me make sure I\\'m not missing anything important. Maybe the official name of the city is \"City of Light,\" which is the official name of Paris. Including that could be helpful. Also, perhaps the area of the city, but I don\\'t remember the exact figure. Maybe around 105 square kilometers? I\\'m not sure, but I\\'ll include it as an estimate.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure would have a top-level object with \"country\" and \"capital.\" The \"capital\" would have an \"info\" array with population, landmarks, area, and official name.

I should double-check some of these numbers to make sure they\\'re accurate, but since I\\'m just recalling, I\\'ll proceed with what I have.\\n\\nWait, I should also consider if there are any other notable facts.

Let me break down what details to include.\\n\\nFirst, the basic information: name, nickname, and location. Paris, obviously, so those are straightforward.\\n\\nNext, population and area. I know Paris is a major city, so maybe around 3.5 million people and an area of about 105 square kilometers. Wait, I should double-check that to make sure it\\'s accurate. Let me think, I\\'ve heard those numbers before, so they seem correct.\\n\\nMoving on to history. Paris as a capital dates back to before the revolution, maybe around the 14th century when it was declared the capital by Napoleon. I think it became a republic in 1820, so I\\'ll include that.\\n\\nCuisine is a good cultural aspect. French patisserie andqn>, I believe quiche is a popular dish. I should list a few iconic dishes and mention their origins, like the Eiffel Tower standing at 334 meters, built by Gustave Eiffel.\\n\\nTransportation: Paris has excellent public transit systems like the Métro, which is famous. Tramlines, buses, and the Château de Jo冶金 station connect different parts of the city.\\n\\nEconomy-wise, Paris has a diverse economy.

      "Prompt: Give me the information of the capital of France in the JSON format.\n",
      "Generated text:  and then convert that JSON into a JSONP object.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, create a JSON array containing 5 different cities in France, each with their population and area.\n",

      "\n",
      "Make sure to include all the required fields: for the city info, it's name, country, population, area, and the capital flag. For the array, each city should have name, population, and area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, so I need to figure out how to structure this JSON data. Let me start by recalling what the user is asking for. They want the information of the capital of France in JSON format, then convert that into a JSONP object. Also, they need a JSON array with 5 different cities in France, each having population and area. Finally, they want a JSON object that combines both the capital info and the array of cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital. So, the JSON for the capital should include its name, country, population, area, and whether it's the capital. Wait, the user mentioned the fields for the city info should be name, country, population, area, and capital flag. So, the JSON for the capital would look like:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"name\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"country\": \"France\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 1000000, // I'm not sure about the exact number, but for example's sake, let's say 1 million.\n",
      "  \"area\": 100000, // Again, approximate values.\n",
      "  \"capital\": true\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to convert this into a JSONP object. JSONP typically wraps the JSON in a function and adds a \"func\" key. So, it would look like:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"func\": function() {\n",
      "    return {\n",
      "      \"name\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "      \"country\": \"France\",\n",
      "      \"population\": 1000000,\n",
      "      \"area\": 100000,\n",
      "      \"capital\": true\n",
      "    };\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but JSONP often uses a function that returns the JSON object. So, the structure is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, moving on to the array of 5 cities in France. I need to list 5 cities, each with their population and area. I should pick well-known cities to make it accurate. Let me think of some major cities in France:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Lyon\n",
      "2. Marseille\n",
      "3. Toulouse\n",
      "4. Lille\n",
      "5. Nîmes\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to find their approximate populations and areas. I might not have exact numbers, so I'll have to estimate or use known approximate values.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Lyon: Population around 400,000, area about 100 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Marseille: Population around 600,000, area about 150 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Toulouse: Population around 300,000, area about 120 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Lille: Population around 450,000, area about 110 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Nîmes: Population around 250,000, area about 80 square kilometers.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the JSON array would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "[\n",
      "  {\n",
      "    \"name\": \"Lyon\",\n",
      "    \"population\": 400000,\n",

      "  {\n",
      "    \"name\": \"Toulouse\",\n",
      "    \"population\": 300000,\n",
      "    \"area\": 120\n",

      "  {\n",
