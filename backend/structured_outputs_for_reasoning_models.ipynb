    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

They mentioned two things: the date/time and the weather. I need to figure out how to get both using the functions provided.<br><br>First, the date and time. The function for that is 'get_current_date', which requires a timezone. Since the user is in New York, I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone parameter. That seems straightforward.<br><br>Next, the weather. The function 'get_current_weather' needs a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, but I should get the state abbreviation. New York is NY, so the state would be 'NY'. They also specified Fahrenheit, so I'll set the unit to 'fahrenheit'. <br><br>I need to make sure I call each function separately because I can only use one function at a time. So, I'll first call 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter. Then, I'll call 'get_current_weather' with the city, state, and unit parameters. <br><br>I should structure each function call according to the format specified. For the date, it's just the timezone. For the weather, it's a JSON object with city, state, and unit. Also, I must include the sources in the response, so I'll mention the OpenWeatherMap and Python's datetime module for the date function.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write two separate function calls, each on its own line, and add the sources at the end to ensure credibility.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function>  <br><br>Sources:  <br>- OpenWeatherMap for weather data  <br>- Python's datetime module for date and time functionality</strong>"

I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see... Yes, according to the latest data, the population is approximately 2,174,300 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \"country\". The city is Paris, the population is the number I found, and the country is France.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. The entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. I\\'ll format it properly to avoid any syntax errors.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have the city, population, and country. I\\'ll present this to the user, making sure it\\'s clear and easy to understand. I don\\'t think the user needs anything more detailed, so this should suffice.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need additional information, like the area or age distribution, but since they only asked for population, I\\'ll stick to that. Maybe they\\'ll ask for more details later, but for now, this response should be helpful.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'e158e5b2ba9b4dadaa7d41b3a75c813d', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 384, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.426164388656616}}</strong>"

Okay, so first, I need to recall the capital of France. Let me think... yes, it\\'s Paris.\\n\\nNow, they want this in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data-interchange format. It\\'s structured with key-value pairs, so that makes sense for the data they\\'re asking for.\\n\\nWhat details do they need? The main capital info: name, country, and population. The population of Paris is a topic that can change, so I should mention that it\\'s approximate because the exact number can vary each year. I\\'ll check the current population, but I know it\\'s around 2 million. Maybe also include the metropolitan area to give a complete picture.\\n\\nI should structure the JSON with an \"🤩\" emoji to make it more engaging. Then, have a \"data\" key containing all the information. The keys under \"data\" could include \"city_name\", \"country\", \"area_sqm\", and \"population\". The population should be an approximate value and have a note that it can change.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should double-check the current population of Paris. I think it\\'s about 2,155,000 as of 2023, but it\\'s best to mention it\\'s approximate. Also, specifying that this is the metropolitan area might be helpful because Paris is a large city with suburbs.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look clear and concise. I\\'ll start with the 🤩 emoji, then state the capital info, and include the population note. That should cover everything the user asked for.\\n</think>\\n\\n ==========\\n\\nThe capital of France is Paris.

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. The capital is Paris, so I need to provide accurate data. I'll start by recalling that Paris is indeed the capital, so that's straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I should find the most recent population figure. I know that population data can change, so I should check the latest stats. I remember that as of 2023, the population was around 3.5 million. But I should confirm that number to be sure. Maybe there are sources like the census or recent studies that can back this up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also include some key facts about Paris to give a comprehensive answer. I know it's a major city, home to the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, and it's a global hub for fashion and culture. Including these points will make the response more informative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, structuring this into JSON. I'll create an object with an \"info\" key containing the city's name and the capital status. Then, an \"population\" key with the number and a \"fact\" key about its significance. Keeping it simple and clear is important for readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if the user needs this for a presentation or just general knowledge. Either way, providing accurate and concise information is key. I'll make sure the JSON is properly formatted without any errors to prevent issues when they use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Double-checking the population figure to ensure it's up to date and accurate. If there's any uncertainty, I might include a note about the data being from a specific year, but since the user didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent figure I have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll present the JSON neatly, maybe with some indentation for better readability, even though the user didn't specify. That way, it's easy to understand and use if needed.\n",
