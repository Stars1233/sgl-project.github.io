    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

Maybe they also need this for a presentation or a report, so accuracy is key. <br><br>I should also consider if there are any other details they might need, like the area or the time zone, but the user specifically asked for population.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'a153e927480b4737ac7083366a5fb6b4', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.623957633972168}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out how to present the information and population of Paris, the capital of France, in JSON format. Hmm, I\\'m not exactly sure, but let me think step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I remember that JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It\\'s a way to structure data using key-value pairs, right? So, I guess I need to create an object where each key corresponds to the information I have, and the value will be the specific data points.\\n\\nThe user is asking for the population of Paris\\'s capital. Wait, Paris is the capital of France, so the population would be that of Paris, France. I think the latest data might have changed, but I recall that around 2021, the population was approximately 2 million people. Let me double-check that—yes, according to recent estimates, Paris has a population around 2,100,000 as of 2023. That sounds about right.\\n\\nNow, the information part—well, Paris is the capital of France, located in the northern part of the country, near the Seine River. It\\'s a major city with rich history, cultural significance, and a vibrant skyline. It\\'s also a center of government, education, and arts. These are all points that should be included in the JSON object to provide a comprehensive overview.\\n\\nSo, structuring this into JSON, I should probably have an object with main capitals, and within that, include both the country and the population. Alternatively, I can have separate keys for country and population, but maybe including the city within the country object makes it more organized.\\n\\nWait, looking back at an example, I think using the country as a key and then including the city name and population under it would make sense. So, something like:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"country\": \"France\",\\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2100000\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nI\\'m not sure if the key should be \"capital\" or maybe \"country_info\" with sub-keys. But the example the user gave was a country object, so perhaps it\\'s better to structure it that way, showing the country details and then the capital info within it.\\n\\nI should also think about the data types. The population is a number, so in JSON, it should be a number type, not a string. So, 2100000 without quotes.\\n\\nWait, but sometimes, for readability, people write numbers with commas, like 2,100,000. But JSON doesn\\'t enforce that, so both are acceptable. Maybe it\\'s better to include it as a string with commas for clarity, like \"2,100,000\", but then the number would be a string type instead. Hmm, but for accurate data, perhaps a numeric type is better without the commas.\\n\\nI think the key points to include are the country, city name, and population. Also, maybe a brief description or some notable facts about Paris would add value. So, perhaps the JSON structure could have an \"About\" key with a description, and another key for population with the number.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I think the JSON should look something like this:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital_info\": {\\n    \"country\": \"France\",\\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2100000,\\n    \"about\": \"Paris is the capital city of France, located in the northern part of the country, known for its rich history, cultural landmarks, andDb.\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nBut I\\'m not sure if the \"about\" part is necessary. The user just asked for information and population, so maybe it\\'s better to keep it straightforward without the description. Alternatively, keeping it as a simple nested structure without the extra text might be cleaner.\\n\\nSo, the final JSON could be:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"country\": \"France\",\\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2100000\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nYes, that seems concise and informative. I don\\'t think I need to add any extra fields unless the user specifies more details. The country and city are direct, and the population is accurate as of 2023.\\n\\nWait, should I ensure the population is up-to-date? I think the latest estimate is around 2.1 million, so 2,100,000 is correct. I just want to make sure that if the user is using this information, it\\'s accurate.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider is formatting—the JSON should be properly indented and syntax correct. So, each key is on a new line, and the JSON is enclosed in curly braces. Commas are placed correctly between key-value pairs, except after the last one.\\n\\nI think that\\'s about it. The JSON structure should clearly show the country as France, the capital as Paris, with a population figure. That should fulfill the user\\'s request effectively.\\n</think>\\n\\n{\"capital\": {\"country\": \"France\", \"city\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2100000}}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'cc5158e228f74c988a82aa03b16a8b2a', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 1064, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 10.383402109146118}}</strong>"

I'll need to make sure the number is accurate and formatted correctly, probably with commas for readability.\n",
