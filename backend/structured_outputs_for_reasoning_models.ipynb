    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see... Yes, according to the latest data, the population is approximately 2,174,300 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \"country\". The city is Paris, the population is the number I found, and the country is France.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. The entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. I\\'ll format it properly to avoid any syntax errors.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have the city, population, and country. I\\'ll present this to the user, making sure it\\'s clear and easy to understand. I don\\'t think the user needs anything more detailed, so this should suffice.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need additional information, like the area or age distribution, but since they only asked for population, I\\'ll stick to that. Maybe they\\'ll ask for more details later, but for now, this response should be helpful.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '54142c0a05fa46fcb44158b62c59b287', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 384, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.5308499336242676}}</strong>"

Hmm, I need to figure out the correct way to respond. First, I should identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, but I want to double-check just to be sure. Yeah, Paris is definitely correct.\\n\\nNow, I need to provide the population. Population numbers can change, so I should look up the most recent estimate. As of 2023, the population of Paris is approximately 2,167,000. But wait, is that the urban area or the metropolitan area? I think for official statistics, they usually refer to the urban area, so that should be fine.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"capital\" and \"population\". Under each key, I\\'ll place the corresponding value. \\n\\nI should also remember to include a message to indicate that the information is accurate as of a specific date. That way, the user knows the data might have changed since then. So the message could say something like \"As of July 1, 2023, the information is accurate.\"\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON properly, making sure the syntax is correct with proper commas and quotes. I don\\'t want any syntax errors because that could cause issues when someone tries to use the JSON data.\\n\\nAdditionally, I should consider if the user might need more detailed information, like population demographics or other stats. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I\\'ll stick to that. However, offering a broader context might be helpful, so I\\'ll include a note suggesting they ask for more if they need it.\\n\\nI should make sure the response is clear and friendly, addressing any potential follow-up questions. Maybe adding an emoji to greet them, like a smiley face, to keep the tone positive and approachable.\\n\\nWait, I just remembered that sometimes the population figures can be slightly different depending on the source and the year. Including a recent year, like 2023, is important for accuracy. Also, the term \" métropole de Paris\" is more precise, so I\\'ll use that in the text for clarity.\\n\\nAlright, I think I\\'ve covered all the necessary points. Now, let me structure the response correctly. I\\'ll start with the JSON object, add the message, and then offer further assistance if needed. Making sure the JSON is properly formatted so it can be easily used.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2167000,\\n  \"message\": \"As of July 1, 2023, the information is accurate.\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf you need further details, feel free to ask!', 'meta_info': {'id': 'c979b62f9e1d40c5a472db502d253558', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 604, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.860034465789795}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Alright, so I need to find the population of the capital of France, which is Paris. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure off the top of my head, but I remember that Paris is a very big city. I think it's one of the most populous cities in the world, maybe around 12 million or so. Let me try to recall any specific numbers or recent trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that France's population is around 40 million, including all its cities and regions. But Paris is the capital, so it's significantly larger. I've heard the number 12.5 million thrown around before, but I'm not 100% certain. Is it 12 million or maybe 13 million? I should check if there's any recent data or sources that provide an accurate figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think I remember that the population has been increasing steadily. Maybe it's around 12.6 million now. Also, considering the distribution of population across different Île-de-France regions, Paris itself is the largest, followed by other cities like Lyon, Marseille, and so on. So if Île-de-France has around 12 million people, then Paris being the capital would naturally have the largest portion of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should consider factors that might affect the population, like urbanization trends, birth rates, mortality rates, and migration. If there's been a lot of immigration into Paris, that could increase the population. Conversely, if there's been a lot of people leaving, the population might be lower. But generally, Paris tends to attract a lot of people, especially young adults, which contributes to its growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, considering that Paris is a global city, it's not just limited to France. So even though the majority of its residents are French, there are also expatriates. This could mean that the total population is a bit higher than the pure French population. But I think the figure I mentioned earlier, 12.6 million, accounts for both residents and expatriates.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if there's any data from official sources. The recent census or maybe some reports from organizations like the World Bank or the United Nations could provide a reliable figure. Let me think if I've come across any such reports recently. I recall that in 2020, the population was around 12.6 million, and it's been growing a bit each year since then.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, I'm going to go with Paris having approximately 12.6 million people. I think that's the most accurate and up-to-date figure I can come up with without doing an actual lookup. Of course, population numbers can change, but this should be a reasonable estimate.\n",
