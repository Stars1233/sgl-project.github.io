    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'f15dc16698d14cb0b8b955dd33f14709', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.872377634048462}}</strong>"

The main points would be the city\\'s name, its area, and its population. I need accurate numbers here.\\n\\nI know the administrative center of Paris is known as le mestража, but the standard name used is Paris. The area of Paris is roughly 105.5 square kilometers, which I can confirm from available sources.\\n\\nRegarding population, I recall that Paris is one of the most populous cities in France. As of the latest estimates from 2022, it\\'s around 2,203,959 people. I should make sure this figure is current to avoid any discrepancies.\\n\\nNow, structuring this into JSON format, I\\'ll create an object with keys \"city\", \"area\", and \"population\". Each key will have its corresponding value. I\\'ll ensure the JSON syntax is correct, using quotation marks and proper formatting to avoid any errors.\\n\\nAdditionally, I should consider if the user might need more detailed information. They didn\\'t specify, so providing just the basics as per their request should suffice. However, I\\'ll present it clearly so they can easily read and use the data.\\n\\nLastly, I\\'ll make sure the response is concise and exactly matches the user\\'s query without including unnecessary information.

      "Generated text: Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to identify the capital of France. From what I know, Paris is the capital of France. That part is pretty straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I should find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is going to be in the millions. I think it's around 2 million people. But I'm not 100% sure, so I should verify that. Let me recall, or maybe I can think of the recent estimates. I believe the population has been fluctuating a bit over the years due to various factors like migration, births, and deaths. However, it's commonly reported as approximately 2 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a way to structure data. So I need to create a JSON object that includes the key pieces of information: the name of the city, its population, and maybe some additional info like the country it's in, just to provide more context.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON structure should have keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \"country\". The population number needs to be accurate, so I'll double-check. I think it's around 2,100,000 as of the latest estimates. I should make sure to represent that correctly in the JSON, using commas appropriately and ensuring the syntax is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the user might be looking for a clear and concise response. So, I should present the JSON without any extra fluff. Keeping it simple and straightforward will make it easier for the user to use the data they receive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if there's any specific format the user prefers for the population number, like using a comma or not. In JSON, numbers don't need commas for thousands separators, so 2100000 is fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to consider is whether the user might need this data for something else, like a report or a presentation. If they're using it programmatically, having the data in JSON is super helpful because it can be easily parsed by scripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about the reliability of the information. Since I'm recalling the population, it's best to present it as an estimate unless I can provide an exact figure. For major cities like Paris, the population is well-documented, so it's acceptable to use the current estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, making sure the JSON is correctly formatted is crucial. Missing a comma or bracket can cause errors when someone tries to use this data in a program. So, attention to detail is important here.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, I need to provide a JSON object with the city name, population, and country, ensuring the population number is accurate and the JSON syntax is correct. This will meet the user's request effectively and any potential follow-up uses they might have.\n",
