    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",
    "- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to generate information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I should recall what Paris is known for. It's the main city in France, right? I know it's a major cultural, economic, and political center. <br><br>I should probably start by listing the basic facts. The capital of France is Paris, so that's straightforward. The country it's the capital of is France, which I can confirm. The location is in the northern part of the country, near the Seine River. I remember that Paris is located in the Île-de-France region, which is a large area including other cities like Lyon and Marseille.<br><br>Next, I should think about the population. I think Paris is the second-largest city in France, after metropolitan Paris, which includes a much larger area. The population numbers might be around 2 million for the city proper and 8 million for the metropolitan area. I should double-check that, but I'm pretty sure that's correct.<br><br>Moving on to landmarks, the Eiffel Tower is a must. It's a symbol of the city and the country. The Louvre Museum is another famous landmark, one of the largest art museums in the world. The Paris Opera House is also iconic, especially for its architecture. The Arc de Triomphe is a significant historical monument, and Notre-Dame, despite the recent issues, is still a major attraction, though it's currently undergoing renovations.<br><br>I should include some key facts about Paris. It's known for its rich history, being the birthplace of many famous people like Victor Hugo, Ernest Hemingway, and others. It's also a global city with a vibrant cultural scene, hosting events like the French网球公开赛 and the Tour de France. The cuisine is a big part of its identity, with famous dishes like croissant and boeuf bourguignon.<br><br>Transportation is another area. Paris has an extensive public transportation system, including the Métro, which is a large subway network. The RER is another rail network that connects to other cities. Taxis are also a common mode of transportation, and there are bike lanes throughout the city, especially in the Île-de-France region.<br><br>I should structure this information into a JSON format. The JSON should have a key for the capital, which is \"Paris\", and then an object containing the details. I'll list each piece of information as a key-value pair under the \"capital\" key. I need to make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets, and that strings are enclosed in quotes.<br><br>Wait, I should also consider the population numbers. I think the population of Paris itself is around 2.1 million, while the metropolitan area is about 8.5 million. I should include that. Also, the area of Paris is approximately 105 square kilometers, and the metropolitan area is about 12,500 square kilometers.<br><br>I should also mention the time zone. Paris is in Central European Time (CET) during standard time and Central European Summer Time (CEST) in summer. That's important for international users.<br><br>Let me organize all this information into a JSON structure. I'll start with the capital key, then include the population, location, landmarks, key facts, transportation, and area. I'll make sure each key is descriptive and the values are accurate.<br><br>I think I've covered all the main points. Now, I'll format it correctly, ensuring that the JSON syntax is correct with proper commas and brackets. I'll avoid any markdown formatting as per the instructions and just present the JSON.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 214300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the information about the capital of France and present it in JSON format. Let me start by recalling what I know about Paris. I know it's the capital, but I should probably double-check that. Yeah, I'm pretty sure Paris is the administrative capital, but sometimes people might confuse it with other cities like Lyon or Marseille. But no, Paris is definitely the official capital.<br><br>Now, moving on to the population. I think Paris is a very large city, one of the biggest in the world. I remember reading somewhere that it's over 3 million people, but I'm not sure of the exact figure. Maybe around 3.5 million? I should look that up to be accurate, but since I'm just brainstorming, I'll go with that estimate.<br><br>Next, the area. Paris is a big city, but it's also a dense urban area. I think the metropolitan area covers a large region, maybe around 12,000 square kilometers? But the city proper is smaller. I'm not exactly sure, but I'll put 10,500 square kilometers for the city area and 12,000 for the metropolitan area.<br><br>Language is another point. Paris is a center for French culture, so the predominant language there is definitely French. I don't think they speak any other language there predominantly, though there might be some English, especially in tourist areas or with expatriates.<br><br>Cuisine is interesting. Paris is known for its high-end, fine dining, especially French cuisine. I know places like Le Faitout and others that are famous for their intricate dishes. Parisians are also known for their coffee culture, so maybe that's another point to include.<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has an extensive public transit system. The RER and地铁 are part of the BTP, which I think stands for Bahn, Tram, and Metro in German, but in French, it's the same. The city is well-connected by train, with major stations like Gare du Nord and Châtelet. The Eiffel Tower is a major landmark, and it's accessible by train from Paris.<br><br>I should also mention some of the main attractions. The Eiffel Tower is iconic, along with the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. These are must-see spots for tourists.<br><br>Now, putting this all together into JSON format. I'll structure it with an \"info\" key that contains a \"capital\" object with \"name,\" \"population,\" \"area,\" and \"language.\" Then, an \"attractions\" array that lists the main points of interest. I'll make sure the numbers are approximate since I don't have exact figures on hand.<br><br>Wait, I should check if the population is over 3 million or 3.5. I think it's around 3.5 million as of recent estimates. The area, I'm pretty sure the metropolitan area is about 12,000 km², and the city proper is a bit less, maybe 10,500 km².

I also remember that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, and it's a symbol of the country. So if Paris is the capital, then that makes sense.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is in New York and wants to know the current date and time, as well as the weather. I need to figure out how to get this information using the functions they provided.<br><br>First, I'll check the functions available. There's 'get_current_date' and 'get_current_weather'. I need to determine if these functions require specific parameters.<br><br>For the date and time, the function requires a timezone. Since the user is in New York, I can use 'America/New_York' as the timezone parameter. That should give me the current date and time in that location.<br><br>Next, for the weather, the function needs a city and state. The user mentioned being in New York, so the city is 'New York' and the state is 'NY'. The unit isn't specified, so I'll default to Celsius for the temperature.<br><br>I'll structure the message by first calling 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter. Then, I'll call 'get_current_weather' with city and state, and set the unit to Celsius. I'll include placeholders for the responses so the user knows to replace them.<br><br>I should make sure each function call is on its own line, using the correct format with start and end tags, and properly JSON-encapsulated parameters. Also, I need to add sources to the answers as per the instructions, so I'll mention the OpenWeatherMap and Python's datetime module for the date information and the OpenWeatherMap for the weather details.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"celsius\"}</function>  <br><br>Sources:  <br>- Date and time information from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and Python's datetime module.  <br>- Weather information from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).</strong>"

      "{'text': 'Okay, so I need to provide the information about the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, I\\'m not entirely sure about all the details, but I\\'ll try to think it through.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty much a given, right? But I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall any other capitals I know. London is the capital of the UK, Rome is Italy, and maybe Tokyo is Japan\\'s. Yeah, Paris seems correct for France.\\n\\nNow, moving on to the population. I think Paris is a very large city, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I remember it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not certain. Maybe around 3.5 million? I should probably look that up, but since I can\\'t right now, I\\'ll go with 3,500,000 as an estimate.\\n\\nNext, the area. Paris is a big city, but I think it\\'s not as large as Tokyo or London. Maybe around 10 square kilometers? I\\'m not sure, but that seems plausible. I\\'ll note that as 10,000,000 square meters.\\n\\nCoordinates are next. Paris is in France, so the country code is \"FR\". The latitude and longitude... I think the approximate coordinates are around 48.8566° N latitude and 2.3522° E longitude. I remember that Paris is in the northern and eastern parts of France, so those should be correct.\\n\\nOfficial languages. France is a country with a lot of languages, but I think French is the official language. I\\'m not sure if they have others, but French is definitely the primary one. Maybe they also have some other languages spoken there, but I\\'ll stick with French for now.\\n\\nOfficial currency is the euro, right? Yeah, I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s correct. They use the euro as their main currency.\\n\\nI should also consider if there\\'s anything else I might need to include. Maybe the capital\\'s nickname? I think Paris is called the \"City of Light\" or something like that. But the user didn\\'t ask for that, so maybe it\\'s not necessary.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with the key-value pairs. The keys should be in English, and the values can be numbers, strings, or maybe even objects if needed. Since the population and area are numerical, I\\'ll represent them as numbers. The rest can be strings.\\n\\nWait, but in JSON, numbers don\\'t have commas, right? So 3,500,000 should be written as 3500000 without the comma. Same with the area, 10,000,000 square meters becomes 10000000.\\n\\nLet me make sure I\\'m formatting the JSON correctly. The keys should be in double quotes, and the values can be numbers or strings. So the structure would be something like:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"area\": 10000000,\\n  \"country\": \"FR\",\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n  },\\n  \"languages\": \"French\",\\n  \"currency\": \"Euro\"\\n}\\n\\nWait, but the coordinates are just two numbers, so maybe I don\\'t need a nested object. So it would be:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"area\": 10000000,\\n  \"country\": \"FR\",\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n  },\\n  \"languages\": \"French\",\\n  \"currency\": \"Euro\"\\n}\\n\\nThat looks better. I think that\\'s all the information I need. I should make sure that the numerical values don\\'t have commas and that the strings are in double quotes. Also, the keys should be in lowercase letters as per JSON standards.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve covered everything. Population and area are estimates, but they\\'re close enough for a general JSON format. I don\\'t think I need to include more details unless specified. So, this should be the correct JSON structure for the information about the capital of France.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000', 'meta_info': {'id': '6ab14998e0454408ada854b2d29119f2', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'length', 'length': 2048}, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 2048, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 20.83363389968872}}\n"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the derivative of a function, right? Let me see. The function is f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5. I remember from class that to find the derivative, I need to use the power rule. \\n\\nAlright, the power rule says that if I have a function like x^n, its derivative is n*x^(n-1). So, applying that to each term of the function should give me the derivative. Let\\'s break it down term by term.\\n\\nFirst term: 3x^2. The exponent is 2, so I bring that down as a coefficient, multiply it by 3, which gives me 6. Then, I reduce the exponent by 1, so it becomes x^(2-1) = x^1, which is just x. So, the derivative of 3x^2 is 6x.\\n\\nSecond term: 2x. The exponent here is 1 because x is the same as x^1. Applying the power rule, I bring down the 1 as a coefficient, multiply it by 2, which gives me 2. Then, reduce the exponent by 1, so it becomes x^(1-1) = x^0, which is 1. So, the derivative of 2x is 2.\\n\\nThird term: -5. This is a constant term. I remember that the derivative of a constant is zero because there\\'s no change as x changes. So, the derivative of -5 is 0.\\n\\nNow, putting it all together, the derivative of f(x) should be 6x + 2. Wait, let me double-check. The first term\\'s derivative is 6x, the second is 2, and the third is 0. So, yes, adding them up gives 6x + 2.\\n\\nI think that\\'s it. But just to be sure, maybe I should plug in a value for x and see if the derivative makes sense. Let\\'s say x = 1. The original function f(1) = 3(1)^2 + 2(1) - 5 = 3 + 2 - 5 = 0. The derivative at x=1 is 6(1) + 2 = 8. So, at the point (1,0), the slope of the tangent line should be 8. That seems reasonable.\\n\\nAnother check: x = 0. f(0) = 3(0)^2 + 2(0) -5 = -5. The derivative at x=0 is 6(0) + 2 = 2. So, the slope at (0,-5) is 2. That also makes sense because the function is a parabola opening upwards, so the slope at the vertex (which is at x = -b/(2a) = -2/(6) = -1/3) should be zero. Wait, but at x=0, it\\'s 2. Hmm, maybe I should calculate the slope at x = -1/3. Let\\'s see, f\\'(-1/3) = 6*(-1/3) + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0. Yes, that\\'s correct. So, the derivative at x=0 is 2, which is positive, meaning the function is increasing there, which aligns with the parabola\\'s shape.\\n\\nI think I\\'m confident now. The derivative is 6x + 2.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"StepbyStepSolution\",\\n\"population\": 1000000000\\n\\n\\n  \\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n \\t\\t}', 'meta_info': {'id': '9890296d19ff46aa9f070c4e0c1dfc2c', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 5, 'completion_tokens': 790, 'cached_tokens': 2, 'e2e_latency': 8.193634986877441}}</strong>"
