    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I remember it's over 3 million, but I'm not certain if it's 3.5 or 3.6. I should double-check that.<br><br>Next, I thought about the structure. The user wants JSON, so I need to format it correctly with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\". I should make sure the syntax is correct—no typos, proper commas, and brackets. <br><br>I also considered the user's possible needs. They might be doing a project or a presentation, so providing accurate data is crucial. Maybe they're a student learning about France's capitals or someone compiling demographic data. Either way, precision is key.<br><br>I decided to present the information clearly, ensuring the JSON is valid and easy to read. I included the population as 3.617 million, which I believe is the most recent figure I could recall.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

No, I'm pretty sure France's capital is Paris. Maybe I should double-check that to be certain. Yeah, Paris is where the government is located, and that's the capital.

I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \"country\". The city is Paris, the population is the number I found, and the country is France.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. The entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. I\\'ll format it properly to avoid any syntax errors.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have the city, population, and country. I\\'ll present this to the user, making sure it\\'s clear and easy to understand. I don\\'t think the user needs anything more detailed, so this should suffice.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need additional information, like the area or age distribution, but since they only asked for population, I\\'ll stick to that.

First, I should identify what the question is asking. The capital of France is Paris. So, I\\'ll focus on Paris for this response.\\n\\nOkay, the user wants this in a JSON format, which is a way of structuring data using key-value pairs. I remember that JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it\\'s commonly used for data interchange.\\n\\nI should include some key pieces of information about Paris. Let\\'s start with the general data. The \"name\" of the city is Paris, and the \"country\" it\\'s in is France. Including the \"coordinates\" might be helpful for locating it on a map. I think the approximate latitude is 48.8566 and longitude is 2.3522.\\n\\nNext, the \"population\" is something the user specifically asked for. The population can vary, but as of the latest estimates, Paris has around 2.2 million people. However, I should note that this figure fluctuates due to births, deaths, and migration.\\n\\nAdditionally, we can include some cultural highlights about Paris. The \"founded year\" is around 753 AD, but acquiring precise information might be difficult, so an approximate date is acceptable. Paris is a major historical and cultural city, known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum. It\\'s also a global financial hub with a major stock exchange.\\n\\nPutting all of this together, I\\'ll structure it into a JSON object. Starting with the city and country, followed by geographical coordinates, population, and then historical and cultural aspects.\\n\\nI have to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotes. Each key should be in quotes, and string values should also be in quotes. The numbers should be appropriately formatted.\\n\\nSo, the JSON structure should look something like this:\\n\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n  },\\n  \"population\": 2241000,\\n  \"founded\": 753,\\n  \" landmarks\": [\"Eiffel Tower\", \"Louvre Museum\"],\\n  \"holidays\": [\"Easter\", \"New Year\"],\\n  \"cultural_impact\": \"A global financial capital and symbol of French culture\"\\n}\\n\\nI think this covers the necessary information the user asked for, presented in a clear and organized JSON format. It’s informative and straightforward, which I believe meets the user\\'s needs.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the JSON information about the capital of France:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n  },\\n  \"population\": 2241000,\\n  \"founded\": 753,\\n  \"landmarks\": [\"Eiffel Tower\", \"Louvre Museum\"],\\n  \"holidays\": [\"Easter\", \"New Year\"],\\n  \"cultural_impact\": \"A global financial capital and symbol of French culture\"\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'ee423c7d91f24627bb984d28b4cb8c61', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 681, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.049026966094971}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out the population of the capital of France, which is Paris, and present it in JSON format. Hmm, where do I start? I know that Paris is the biggest city in France, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact population number. I think it's over 3 million people, but I'm not certain if it's 3.5 million or 3.7 million. Maybe I should check some reliable sources or memory if I can recall recent data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I remember hearing that Paris has grown a lot in the last few decades. I think the population was around 3.5 million a few years ago, but it might have increased a bit. Maybe it's now about 3.6 million or 3.7 million. I'm not entirely sure, so I should look it up to be accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since I can't access the internet right now, I have to go with my best estimate. I'll go with 3.7 million because I think that's what recent estimates say. Now, how do I format this into JSON? JSON requires a specific structure, with key-value pairs in curly braces. So the key here would be \"population\" and the value would be the number.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for the keys and string values, and proper commas and brackets. So it should look something like {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": \"3.7 million\"}. Wait, but the user didn't specify if the population should be a number or a string. Since population is a count, maybe it's better to represent it as a number without the word \"million\". So perhaps {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 3700000}.\n",
      "\n",
      "But do I know the exact figure? I'm not 100% sure, so maybe I should note that it's an estimate. Alternatively, if I have to provide an exact number, I might need to say that the latest data from 2023 puts the population at approximately 3.7 million. So maybe I should write it as {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 3700000} and mention that it's an estimate.\n",
