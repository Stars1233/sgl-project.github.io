    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Alright, let's break down how I approached the user's request. The user said, \"You are in New York. Please get the current date and time, and the weather.\" So, I need to provide two pieces of information: the current date and time in New York and the weather there.<br><br>First, I identified the functions I have access to. There's 'get_current_weather' which requires city, state, and unit, and 'get_current_date' which needs a timezone. Since the user is in New York, I can assume the timezone is 'America/New_York'.<br><br>I realized that I need to call both functions. I decided to structure the response by first getting the current date and time using 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter. Then, I would call 'get_current_weather' with the city 'New York' and state 'NY', and specify Fahrenheit as the unit.<br><br>I made sure to format each function call correctly, using the specified JSON structure within the curly braces. For the date and time, I used 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter set to 'America/New_York'. For the weather, I included 'New York' as the city and 'NY' as the state, along with the unit 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>I also considered the order of the responses, making sure to present the date and time first, followed by the weather information. I included the sources in the response to show where the information came from, but since I'm using the functions provided, I noted that they are based on the available data.<br><br>Finally, I made sure the entire response was concise and followed the format the user specified, ensuring each function call was on one line and properly tagged.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'e227a1a5a70d42bc9ffc8a98d9aa1ca8', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.146898031234741}}</strong>"

First, I need to ensure I have all the correct data about Paris. I remember Paris is the administrative capital, but I should double-check the actual urban population to make sure it\\'s the most recent figure. Since populations can change over time, it\\'s important to provide accurate and up-to-date information.\\n\\nI\\'ll start by structuring the JSON as they requested. It should have a \"name\" and \"population\" field. The name is straightforward - \"Paris\". For the population, I recall the latest data is around 2.1 million as of 2023. I should note that the urban area is approximately 2.16 million. Also, it\\'s good to mention that the metropolitan area is larger, about 12.4 million, in case the user is interested in a broader context. Including theLiberty City reference is a nice touch because it adds a bit of local flavor.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets. The field names should be in English, but the value for population includes the number with commas for clarity. Translating \"urbain\" to \"urban\" makes it more understandable for an English-speaking audience. \\n\\nI need to present this information clearly and concisely, avoiding any unnecessary jargon. The user probably needs this for a quick reference or maybe for a presentation, so accuracy is key. Also, it\\'s polite to include a friendly note inviting further questions, just in case they need more details later on.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the response as a proper JSON structure, ensuring it\\'s easy to read and use. I\\'ll make sure the numbers are correct and cite the year to provide context. This should fulfill the user\\'s request effectively.\\n</think>\\n\\nSure!
