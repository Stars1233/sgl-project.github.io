    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the current date and time in New York and the weather there. Let me think about how to approach this.<br><br>First, I remember that the user mentioned two functions: get_current_weather and get_current_date. I should probably use both of them. <br><br>Starting with the date, I need to use get_current_date. The function requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I should set the timezone to 'America/New_York'. So the function call would look like get_current_date{'timezone': 'America/New_York'}. That should give me the current date and time in New York.<br><br>Next, for the weather. I need to use get_current_weather. The function requires a city, state, and unit. The user is in New York, which is in New York state. The city is New York, but wait, sometimes the state abbreviation is needed. The state abbreviation for New York is NY. And the unit should be in Fahrenheit since that's common for U.S. weather. So the parameters would be city: 'New York', state: 'NY', unit: 'fahrenheit'. That makes the function call get_current_weather{'city': 'New York', 'state': 'NY', 'unit': 'fahrenheit'}.<br><br>I should make sure to structure the function calls correctly. Each function call needs to be on its own line and in the specified format. So first, I'll write the date function, then the weather function. Each with the correct parameters.<br><br>Wait, is the unit required? Yes, according to the function description, unit is required. So I need to include it. Also, the state must be two letters, which 'NY' is, so that's correct.<br><br>Putting it all together, I can send both function calls in the message. I think that's all. Let me double-check the parameters to make sure I didn't miss anything. City is correct, state is NY, unit is fahrenheit. Timezone is America/New_York.

First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. So that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, they want the population. I should look up the most recent data. From what I remember, Paris has a population around 2 million, but that\\'s an approximate figure. The exact number can vary each year due to births, deaths, and migration.\\n\\nI should also consider the data\\'s source. Official sources like Insee or INSEEPARIS usually provide the most accurate and up-to-date information. I\\'ll check their latest reports to get the figure. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I believe the population is approximately 2,165,434. But I should mention that this is subject to change and encourage the user to verify the current data.\\n\\nThen, I need to structure this into a JSON format. JSON is a data interchange format, so the structure will be a key-value pair. The keys will be \"capital\", \"population\", and possibly \"region\". Under each key, I\\'ll place the respective information and the population number.\\n\\nI should make sure to format the numbers correctly in JSON, using commas appropriately and ensuring the structure is valid. Also, since the user might want this for programming purposes, keeping the JSON clean and accurate is crucial.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, mentioning that this data is approximate and that the user should check the latest sources. That way, I\\'m providing helpful information while also being cautious about the accuracy of static data.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": \"Approximately 2,165,434 (as of recent estimates)\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nPlease note that population figures may vary depending on the source and the year of the data.
