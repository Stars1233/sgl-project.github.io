    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

I need to figure out how to respond using the allowed functions.<br><br>First, the user wants the current date and time for a specific timezone. I remember there's a function called get_current_date that takes a timezone parameter. So I should use that function for the date and time.<br><br>Next, they also want the weather in New York. The weather function, get_current_weather, requires a city and state. New York's state is NY, so I'll need to provide both 'New York' and 'NY' as parameters.<br><br>I need to make sure I don't call both functions in one message. I'll handle them separately. First, I'll call get_current_date with the timezone set to 'America/New_York'. Then, I'll call get_current_weather with city as 'New York' and state as 'NY'.<br><br>I have to format each function call correctly, using the specified JSON structure within the tags. Also, I should mention the sources I used, like the function definitions and the assistant's knowledge.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll reply with two separate function calls, each properly formatted and citing the relevant sources.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br>Source: The function definition for get_current_date.<br><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY)}</function> Source: The function definition for get_current_weather. I assume New York is NY state. This is based on the user's location in New York. I could be wrong, but I will proceed with that assumption.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, someone just asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I need to figure out who the user is and why they\\'re asking this. They might be a student working on a project, someone doing a quick check, or maybe they\\'re developing an app that requires current demographic data.\\n\\nI should consider the context. The user specifically mentioned JSON, so they likely need this data programmatically. JSON is a common format for data exchange, so maybe they\\'re integrating it into a web application or script. That means the information should be precise and formatted correctly.\\n\\nNext, thinking about the accuracy. Population numbers can change frequently, so I need to look up the most recent data. As of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million. But wait, isn\\'t the population growing? Maybe it\\'s better to check reliable sources like the latest census or official government publications for the most accurate number.\\n\\nAlso, what about the date when this data was relevant? The user didn\\'t specify, so I should include a note about the data being up to April 2023. That way, if they\\'re using it for something that requires current information, they know the data might change.\\n\\nLooking at the structure, a JSON format often uses a key-value pair. So I\\'ll include \"city\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2140500, and maybe an \"updated_on\" key with the date. That seems straightforward and useful for developers or anyone parsing the data.\\n\\nI should also consider if there\\'s any unit involved, like millions. Adding \"approx\" could make it clearer that the number is an approximation. That might be helpful for users who are not developers but still need this info.\\n\\nIs there anything else needed? Maybe a note explaining that the data is approximate and could change. That adds transparency and prevents relying solely on the provided figure without context.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll draft the JSON with the city, population, and an approximate note. Ensuring the formatting is correct with proper commas and brackets is crucial to avoid errors when parsing the JSON later on.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll review the JSON structure to make sure there are no typos and that the information is accurate and presented in the most user-friendly way possible. This should meet the user\\'s needs effectively, whether they\\'re a researcher, developer, or just someone needing quick data.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2140500,\\n  \"approx\": \"Approximately 2,140,500 people as of April 2023\"\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '6fe80ecd92e5475ba2c799324f16075a', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 564, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.174624681472778}}</strong>"
