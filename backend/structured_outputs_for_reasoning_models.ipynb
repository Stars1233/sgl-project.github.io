    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

No, I'm pretty sure France's capital is Paris. Maybe I should double-check that to be certain. Yeah, Paris is where the government is located, and that's the capital.

Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I know the user wants the current date and time for New York, considering time zones. I remember there's a function called get_current_date that can do this. The parameters for this function require a timezone, which for New York would be 'America/New_York'. So I should make a function call like <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>.<br><br>Next, for the weather. The user is in New York, so I need the weather in that location. I think the city is 'New York', but I'm not sure if the function requires the full name or just the state abbreviation. Wait, the function's description says it needs 'city' and 'state' as separate parameters. So I should include both. The state abbreviation for New York is NY. The unit is probably Fahrenheit since it's common in the US, so I'll set unit='fahrenheit'. So the weather function call would be <function=get_current_weather '{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function>.<br><br>I should also remember to mention that I'm using these functions and their parameters as per the guidelines. I'll make sure to format everything correctly, keeping each function call on its own line as specified.

The user might be using this data for a project or a report, so it needs to be clean and well-organized. I can include various fields like the capital\\'s nickname, location, key landmarks, area, population, and whether it\\'s a list city. \\n\\nI also want to add interesting facts to make the response more engaging. Maybe something about the bridges in Paris or its status as a global city. Lists of popular attractions could be useful for tourists or researchers. \\n\\nI should maintain a consistent and formal tone, ensuring the JSON is valid and easy to read. Including the population with the exact number and units is important for clarity. \\n\\nI\\'ll make sure to break down the information into relevant sections and fields in the JSON, keeping it organized.

      "Generated text: Okay, I just received a user request to provide the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let me break this down. The user is asking for a specific piece of data, so they might be working on a project or maybe just curious about some facts. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to recall what the capital of France is. I know it's Paris. That part is pretty straightforward. Now, about the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so it's a large urban area. But I should be careful not to confuse it with the metropolitan area, which includes neighboring towns. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, when they say \"capital of France,\" do they mean the administrative capital or the most populous urban area? The administrative capital is definitely Paris, but the urban population is definitely higher. I think the metropolitan area has over 12 million people. That number has grown over the years, especially with international students and expatriates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user is asking for a JSON format. So I need to structure it properly. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with \"Capital\" and \"Population\" as keys. For the population, I should include both the urban area and the metropolitan area to give a complete picture. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure the numbers are up to date. I believe the metropolitan area population is around 12.5 million as of 2023. But just to be safe, maybe I can double-check that. Alternatively, since I'm an AI, I don't have real-time data, so I'll stick with the commonly accepted figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll format it as a JSON object with the keys and the respective values. The user might be using this data for a report, a presentation, or maybe a simple project. Either way, providing accurate and clear information is key. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if the user might be looking for something more detailed, but since they asked for a JSON format, I'll stick to that. Maybe a simple object with two key-value pairs is enough unless they specify otherwise. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, to sum up, the JSON should have the capital as \"Paris\" and the population of the metropolitan area as 12,500,000. That should cover their request comprehensively.\n",
