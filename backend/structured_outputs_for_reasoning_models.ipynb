    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '2c7dbd193da2439b9ae3f69170650182', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.934017658233643}}</strong>"

So first, I need to make sure I have the right details about Paris. Let me think, Paris\\'s population is pretty substantial. I believe it\\'s over 3 million, but I should double-check the exact figure. Maybe around 3.5 million as of the latest data?\\n\\nWait, I should verify the current population. I know that city populations can change each year due to births, deaths, and migration. So I\\'ll look up the latest estimate. Maybe I find that the population is approximately 3,573,682 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\\n\\nNow, for the background information. Paris is a major city in France, known not just for its population but also for its rich history and significance in various fields like art, culture, and politics. It\\'s often called the \"City of Light\" because of the numerous bridges, tunnels, and islands. The Eiffel Tower is iconic there, and the Tuileries Palace is a famous landmark. Also, Paris is the headquarters of a lot of international organizations like the EU and the UN.\\n\\nI think the user is probably looking for a quick data point, maybe for a project or a report. They specified JSON format, which is commonly used for data interchange, so providing it in a structured way would make sense. They might want it for easy parsing or integration into another application.\\n\\nLet me make sure not to include extra details unless they ask for more. So the JSON should have \"Population\" and \"CapitalInfo\" fields. Population should be a number, and CapitalInfo should have subfields like name, significance, landmarks, and organizations.\\n\\nWait, the user wrote \"the capital of France,\" but actually, Paris is the capital, and the country\\'s capital city. Oh, wait, no, France is a country whose capital is Paris, and the state\\'s capital is also Paris. So maybe clarify that in the CapitalInfo.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have the population number and the comprehensive info about Paris. I should present it clearly so it\\'s easy to read and use for whatever purpose the user has. Also, maybe mention that the information is up to date as of 2023 or the specific date where the data was fetched to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nAlright, I think I\\'m ready to structure the JSON response now, ensuring it\\'s accurate and meets the user\\'s request.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"Population\": 3573682,\\n  \"CapitalInfo\": {\\n    \"Name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"Significance\": \"Paris is the capital of France and one of the most important cities in Europe, historically, culturally, and politically.\",\\n    \"Landmarks\": [\\n      \"Eiffel Tower\",\\n      \"Tuileries Palace\",\\n      \"Notre-Dame Cathedral\",\\n      \"Les Halles\\n    ],\\n    \"International Organizations\": [\\n      \"European Union\",\\n      \"United Nations Office\",\\n      \"Paris Agreement\"\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON contains the population of Paris as of the latest data and general information about the city.

      "Next, I need to find the population of Paris. Population figures can change over time, so I should look up the most recent data. I recall that as of 2021, the population was around 2.1 million. But I should verify that. Let me check a reliable source or maybe a government website to confirm. Hmm, yes, the latest official estimate from 2022 puts it at approximately 2,155,000 people.\n",

      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. So I'll structure it with a key for the city and a key for the population. Each key will be a string, and the population will be an integer since it's a count of people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should have an \"info\" key with a \"city\" that says \"Paris\" and a \"population\" that's the number we found. I should make sure the syntax is correct, using commas and quotes appropriately. No trailing commas after the values to keep it valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include units? The population is given without units, which is standard in JSON when it's just a number. Also, considering the user asked for population, they might be looking for a numerical value rather than a formatted string, so that's fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there any other information they might need? They specifically asked for population, so maybe just that. But if they wanted more details, like area or density, they could ask for that separately. But since they didn't, I'll stick to the population.\n",
