    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France and provide its population in JSON format. Let me start by recalling what I know about France. I know that Paris is the capital city, but wait, is that correct? I think so, yeah. It\\'s been the capital for a long time. Now, I need the population. I remember reading some statistics before, maybe around 10 million. But I\\'m not entirely sure. Is it exact or an approximate number?\\n\\nI should probably verify that. Maybe I can think about recent years because populations can change. I know the population numbers change every few years with censuses or estimates. So if Paris\\'s population is around 10 million, maybe it\\'s been a bit more or less recently? I\\'m not certain, but I think 10 million is a commonly cited figure.\\n\\nWait, sometimes I hear people talk about Paris being the most visited city in the world, not necessarily the most populous. So it\\'s possible that while it\\'s a large city, maybe not the very largest in terms of population. But I don\\'t think it\\'s that low. Maybe it\\'s more than 10 million. Hmm. Let me try to think of any landmarks or official sources I\\'ve heard about.\\n\\nOh, I think I remember something about Paris having a population over ten million, maybe around 10.5 million. Or perhaps it\\'s 11 million. I\\'m a bit fuzzy on the exact number. But to be safe, I can go with 10.5 or 11 million as an approximate figure and round it to keep it simple.\\n\\nAlso, I should make sure that the capital\\'s population figure is reliable. I think in recent years, around 2020, Paris had a population of about 10.52 million, if I\\'m not mistaken. So maybe the exact number is around there. I\\'ll go with 10.5 million for now, just to have a clear number in the JSON.\\n\\nSo the info I need to include in JSON is: the capital city, Paris, its country, France, and the population, which I\\'ll approximate as 10.5 million. I need to make sure the JSON format is correct, with strings in quotes and proper syntax for keys and braces.\\n\\nLet me outline the JSON structure. It should be an object with a \"capital\" key that is another object containing \"city\" and \"country\" as strings, and a \"population\" key which is a number. So it would look like this:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"country\": \"France\"\\n  },\\n  \"population\": 10500000\\n}\\n\\nPutting that together, I think that\\'s the correct format. I should double-check that I didn\\'t miss any commas or have any syntax errors. The capital part is an object with two properties, and the population is a standalone number. Yeah, that seems right.\\n\\nI don\\'t think I need to include any units, just the number. It\\'s population, so it\\'s 10,500,000. I think that\\'s correct. I hope I\\'m not too far off with the population number, but based on what I remember and what I can reason, this should be accurate enough.\\n\\nAlright, I think that\\'s all I need. Time to present the JSON as instructed.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"country\": \"France\"\\n  },\\n  \"population\": 10500000\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '7312278481e74caeb425911e3e52a70a', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 748, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.2602338790893555}}</strong>"
