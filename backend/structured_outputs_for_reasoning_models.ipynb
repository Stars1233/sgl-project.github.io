    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",
    "- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to generate information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I should recall what Paris is known for. It's the main city in France, right? I know it's a major cultural, economic, and political center. <br><br>I should probably start by listing the basic facts. The capital of France is Paris, so that's straightforward. The country it's the capital of is France, which I can confirm. The location is in the northern part of the country, near the Seine River. I remember that Paris is located in the Île-de-France region, which is a large area including other cities like Lyon and Marseille.<br><br>Next, I should think about the population. I think Paris is the second-largest city in France, after metropolitan Paris, which includes a much larger area. The population numbers might be around 2 million for the city proper and 8 million for the metropolitan area. I should double-check that, but I'm pretty sure that's correct.<br><br>Moving on to landmarks, the Eiffel Tower is a must. It's a symbol of the city and the country. The Louvre Museum is another famous landmark, one of the largest art museums in the world. The Paris Opera House is also iconic, especially for its architecture. The Arc de Triomphe is a significant historical monument, and Notre-Dame, despite the recent issues, is still a major attraction, though it's currently undergoing renovations.<br><br>I should include some key facts about Paris. It's known for its rich history, being the birthplace of many famous people like Victor Hugo, Ernest Hemingway, and others. It's also a global city with a vibrant cultural scene, hosting events like the French网球公开赛 and the Tour de France. The cuisine is a big part of its identity, with famous dishes like croissant and boeuf bourguignon.<br><br>Transportation is another area. Paris has an extensive public transportation system, including the Métro, which is a large subway network. The RER is another rail network that connects to other cities. Taxis are also a common mode of transportation, and there are bike lanes throughout the city, especially in the Île-de-France region.<br><br>I should structure this information into a JSON format. The JSON should have a key for the capital, which is \"Paris\", and then an object containing the details. I'll list each piece of information as a key-value pair under the \"capital\" key. I need to make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets, and that strings are enclosed in quotes.<br><br>Wait, I should also consider the population numbers. I think the population of Paris itself is around 2.1 million, while the metropolitan area is about 8.5 million. I should include that. Also, the area of Paris is approximately 105 square kilometers, and the metropolitan area is about 12,500 square kilometers.<br><br>I should also mention the time zone. Paris is in Central European Time (CET) during standard time and Central European Summer Time (CEST) in summer. That's important for international users.<br><br>Let me organize all this information into a JSON structure. I'll start with the capital key, then include the population, location, landmarks, key facts, transportation, and area. I'll make sure each key is descriptive and the values are accurate.<br><br>I think I've covered all the main points. Now, I'll format it correctly, ensuring that the JSON syntax is correct with proper commas and brackets. I'll avoid any markdown formatting as per the instructions and just present the JSON.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 214300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the information about the capital of France and present it in JSON format. Let me start by recalling what I know about Paris. I know it's the capital, but I should probably double-check that. Yeah, I'm pretty sure Paris is the administrative capital, but sometimes people might confuse it with other cities like Lyon or Marseille. But no, Paris is definitely the official capital.<br><br>Now, moving on to the population. I think Paris is a very large city, one of the biggest in the world. I remember reading somewhere that it's over 3 million people, but I'm not sure of the exact figure. Maybe around 3.5 million? I should look that up to be accurate, but since I'm just brainstorming, I'll go with that estimate.<br><br>Next, the area. Paris is a big city, but it's also a dense urban area. I think the metropolitan area covers a large region, maybe around 12,000 square kilometers? But the city proper is smaller. I'm not exactly sure, but I'll put 10,500 square kilometers for the city area and 12,000 for the metropolitan area.<br><br>Language is another point. Paris is a center for French culture, so the predominant language there is definitely French. I don't think they speak any other language there predominantly, though there might be some English, especially in tourist areas or with expatriates.<br><br>Cuisine is interesting. Paris is known for its high-end, fine dining, especially French cuisine. I know places like Le Faitout and others that are famous for their intricate dishes. Parisians are also known for their coffee culture, so maybe that's another point to include.<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has an extensive public transit system. The RER and地铁 are part of the BTP, which I think stands for Bahn, Tram, and Metro in German, but in French, it's the same. The city is well-connected by train, with major stations like Gare du Nord and Châtelet. The Eiffel Tower is a major landmark, and it's accessible by train from Paris.<br><br>I should also mention some of the main attractions. The Eiffel Tower is iconic, along with the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. These are must-see spots for tourists.<br><br>Now, putting this all together into JSON format. I'll structure it with an \"info\" key that contains a \"capital\" object with \"name,\" \"population,\" \"area,\" and \"language.\" Then, an \"attractions\" array that lists the main points of interest. I'll make sure the numbers are approximate since I don't have exact figures on hand.<br><br>Wait, I should check if the population is over 3 million or 3.5. I think it's around 3.5 million as of recent estimates. The area, I'm pretty sure the metropolitan area is about 12,000 km², and the city proper is a bit less, maybe 10,500 km².

I also remember that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, and it's a symbol of the country. So if Paris is the capital, then that makes sense.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is in New York and wants to know the current date and time, as well as the weather. I need to figure out how to get both pieces of information using the functions provided.<br><br>First, I should use the 'get_current_date' function. The parameters required are the timezone. Since the user is in New York, I need to find the correct timezone code. I remember that New York is usually in the 'America/New_York' timezone, so that should be the parameter value.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I should use the 'get_current_weather' function. The parameters needed are the city and state. The city is New York, and the state abbreviation is NY. The unit isn't specified, so I'll leave it as 'celsius' since that's a common unit, but I should check if the function requires it. Wait, looking back, the function does have 'unit' as an optional parameter with enum ['celsius', 'fahrenheit']. Maybe I should specify it as 'celsius' to be safe.<br><br>I need to structure the responses correctly. For each function call, I'll format it as <function=...>{parameters}</function>. So for the date, it'll be <function=get_current_date>{timezone: 'America/New_York'}</function>. For the weather, it'll be <function=get_current_weather>{city: 'New York', state: 'NY', unit: 'celsius'}</function>.<br><br>I should also add sources, but since these are direct function calls, the sources might be the functions' documentation or the provided API. I'll mention that the information is based on the functions' outputs.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll list each function call separately to make it clear.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{  <br>  \"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"  <br>}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{  <br>  \"city\": \"New York\",  <br>  \"state\": \"NY\",  <br>  \"unit\": \"celsius\"  <br>}</function></strong>"

      "{'text': 'Okay, so I need to provide the information about the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, I\\'m not entirely sure about all the details, but I\\'ll try to think it through.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty much a given, right? But I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall any other capitals I know. London is the capital of the UK, Rome is Italy, and maybe Tokyo is Japan\\'s. Yeah, Paris seems correct for France.\\n\\nNow, moving on to the population. I think Paris is a very large city, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I remember it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not certain. Maybe around 3.5 million? I should probably look that up, but since I can\\'t right now, I\\'ll go with 3,500,000 as an estimate.\\n\\nNext, the area. Paris is a big city, but I think it\\'s not as large as Tokyo or London. Maybe around 10 square kilometers? I\\'m not sure, but that seems plausible. I\\'ll note that as 10,000,000 square meters.\\n\\nCoordinates are next. Paris is in France, so the country code is \"FR\". The latitude and longitude... I think the approximate coordinates are around 48.8566° N latitude and 2.3522° E longitude. I remember that Paris is in the northern and eastern parts of France, so those should be correct.\\n\\nOfficial languages. France is a country with a lot of languages, but I think French is the official language. I\\'m not sure if they have others, but French is definitely the primary one. Maybe they also have some other languages spoken there, but I\\'ll stick with French for now.\\n\\nOfficial currency is the euro, right? Yeah, I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s correct. They use the euro as their main currency.\\n\\nI should also consider if there\\'s anything else I might need to include. Maybe the capital\\'s nickname? I think Paris is called the \"City of Light\" or something like that. But the user didn\\'t ask for that, so maybe it\\'s not necessary.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with the key-value pairs. The keys should be in English, and the values can be numbers, strings, or maybe even objects if needed. Since the population and area are numerical, I\\'ll represent them as numbers. The rest can be strings.\\n\\nWait, but in JSON, numbers don\\'t have commas, right? So 3,500,000 should be written as 3500000 without the comma. Same with the area, 10,000,000 square meters becomes 10000000.\\n\\nLet me make sure I\\'m formatting the JSON correctly. The keys should be in double quotes, and the values can be numbers or strings. So the structure would be something like:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"area\": 10000000,\\n  \"country\": \"FR\",\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n  },\\n  \"languages\": \"French\",\\n  \"currency\": \"Euro\"\\n}\\n\\nWait, but the coordinates are just two numbers, so maybe I don\\'t need a nested object. So it would be:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"area\": 10000000,\\n  \"country\": \"FR\",\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n  },\\n  \"languages\": \"French\",\\n  \"currency\": \"Euro\"\\n}\\n\\nThat looks better. I think that\\'s all the information I need. I should make sure that the numerical values don\\'t have commas and that the strings are in double quotes. Also, the keys should be in lowercase letters as per JSON standards.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve covered everything. Population and area are estimates, but they\\'re close enough for a general JSON format. I don\\'t think I need to include more details unless specified. So, this should be the correct JSON structure for the information about the capital of France.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000', 'meta_info': {'id': '09d01f0449eb4e638b99acb94e2b7e0b', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'length', 'length': 2048}, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 2048, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 20.042224645614624}}\n"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the derivative of a function, right? Let me see. The function is f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5. I remember from class that to find the derivative, I need to use the power rule. \\n\\nAlright, the power rule says that if I have a function like x^n, its derivative is n*x^(n-1). So, applying that to each term of the function should give me the derivative. Let\\'s break it down term by term.\\n\\nFirst term: 3x^2. The exponent is 2, so I bring that down as a coefficient, multiply it by 3, which gives me 6. Then, I reduce the exponent by 1, so it becomes x^(2-1) = x^1, which is just x. So, the derivative of 3x^2 is 6x.\\n\\nSecond term: 2x. The exponent here is 1 because x is the same as x^1. Applying the power rule, I bring down the 1 as a coefficient, multiply it by 2, which gives me 2. Then, reduce the exponent by 1, so it becomes x^(1-1) = x^0, which is 1. So, the derivative of 2x is 2.\\n\\nThird term: -5. This is a constant term. I remember that the derivative of a constant is zero because there\\'s no change as x changes. So, the derivative of -5 is 0.\\n\\nNow, putting it all together, the derivative of f(x) should be 6x + 2. Wait, let me double-check. The first term\\'s derivative is 6x, the second is 2, and the third is 0. So, yes, adding them up gives 6x + 2.\\n\\nI think that\\'s it. But just to be sure, maybe I should plug in a value for x and see if the derivative makes sense. Let\\'s say x = 1. The original function f(1) = 3(1)^2 + 2(1) - 5 = 3 + 2 - 5 = 0. The derivative at x=1 is 6(1) + 2 = 8. So, at the point (1,0), the slope of the tangent line should be 8. That seems reasonable.\\n\\nAnother check: x = 0. f(0) = 3(0)^2 + 2(0) -5 = -5. The derivative at x=0 is 6(0) + 2 = 2. So, the slope at (0,-5) is 2. That also makes sense because the function is a parabola opening upwards, so the slope at the vertex (which is at x = -b/(2a) = -2/(6) = -1/3) should be zero. Wait, but at x=0, it\\'s 2. Hmm, maybe I should calculate the slope at x = -1/3. Let\\'s see, f\\'(-1/3) = 6*(-1/3) + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0. Yes, that\\'s correct. So, the derivative at x=0 is 2, which is positive, meaning the function is increasing there, which aligns with the parabola\\'s shape.\\n\\nI think I\\'m confident now. The derivative is 6x + 2.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"StepbyStepSolution\",\\n\"population\": 1000000000\\n\\n\\n  \\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n \\t\\t}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'fb351b1b347046bdb4af0c13104c1a82', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 5, 'completion_tokens': 790, 'cached_tokens': 2, 'e2e_latency': 7.559566497802734}}</strong>"

First, the full name is straightforward: \"Paris, Île-de-France.\" That\\'s good.\\n\\nNext, the population. I remember Paris has a large population, maybe around 2 million? I should check that later, but I\\'ll go with 2,158,000 for now. And its region is Île-de-France, which I think is correct because Paris is part of a larger area.\\n\\nCoordinates are important too. I think the latitude is north, so positive numbers, something like 48.8584 and longitude is east, so about 2.3522. I should double-check that, but that seems right.\\n\\nClimate-wise, Paris has a temperate maritime climate, so that fits with its location on the Seine River. I should mention that.\\n\\nOfficial languages are crucial. Paris is known for being bilingual, speaking both French and English, so that\\'s definitely important. Maybe also some other languages, but English and French are the main ones.\\n\\nKey landmarks are common, like the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame, the Louvre, and maybe the Arc de Triomphe. That should cover the main attractions.\\n\\n Flag is essential. The Eiffel Tower and the Seine are part of the symbolism, so I think including those makes sense.\\n\\nMajor industries would be manufacturing, tourism, fashion, and services. France is a big player in those sectors, so Paris as the capital makes sense for all of them.\\n\\nGeographical features include a river, the Seine, which is vital for transportation and commerce.\\n\\nCuisine is a big part of Paris, so French food should definitely be mentioned, highlighting the diversity like bistros, patisseries, and fresh produce.\\n\\nTransportation includes the metro,ဘ.alias, and theck区域性 trains. Also mentioning the Eiffel Tower as a prominent landmark.\\n\\nWebsites like Wikipedia and official旅游 sites like tourismpell.com are standard for a city like Paris.\\n\\nAdministrative info: the mayor is Anne Hidalgo as of 2023, and it\\'s part of Île-de-France. The area is about 10 square kilometers, which sounds correct.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together into a proper JSON structure, I\\'ll make sure each key is correct and uses commas properly to separate the values. I think that covers the main aspects. I should also ensure that the soft words are enclosed in double quotes and numerical data are without quotes.\\n\\nWait, did I miss anything? Maybe something like major languages also includes Spanish, German, and Italian? Or maybe not, since English is widely spoken. I\\'ll stick to English and French as the main ones.\\n\\nAlso, checking the population number, I think it\\'s a bit low now. Maybe it\\'s around 2.1 million? I think I might have a slightly outdated figure earlier, but for the sake of this exercise, I\\'ll keep it as 2,158,000.\\n\\nAlright, I think I have enough to structure the JSON properly. Time to put it all together.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the JSON representation of the information about Paris, the capital of France:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"full_name\": \"Paris, Île-de-France\",\\n    \"population\": 2158000,\\n    \"region\": \"Île-de-France\",\\n    \"coordinates\": {\\n      \"latitude\": 48.8584,\\n      \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n    },\\n    \"climate\": \"Temperate maritime\",\\n    \"official_languages\": [\"French\", \"English\"],\\n    \"key_landmarks\": [\"Eiffel Tower\", \"Notre-Dame Cathedral\", \"Louvre Museum\", \"Arc de Triomphe\"],\\n    \"flag\": {\\n      \"symbolism\": [\"Eiffel Tower\", \"Seine River\"]\\n    },\\n    \"major_industries\": [\"Manufacturing\", \"Tourism\", \"Fashion\", \"Services\"],\\n    \"geographical_features\": [\"Seine River\"],\\n    \"cuisine\": [\"French Food\"],\\n    \"transportation\": {\\n      \"system\": [\"Metro\", \"Tronçons\", \"RER\"],\\n      \"landmark\": [\"Eiffel Tower\"]\\n    },\\n    \"websites\": [\"Wikipedia\", \"Official Tourism website\"],\\n    \"administrative\": {\\n      \"mayor\": \"Anne Hidalgo\",\\n      \"region\": \"Île-de-France\",\\n      \"area\": 10,\\n      \"population_quart\": 4974\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON structure encapsulates essential details about Paris, including demographics, geography, economy, and social aspects, providing a comprehensive overview.', 'meta_info': {'id': '22a5f223089a474596c72da4230f9309', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 1001, 'cached_tokens': 19, 'e2e_latency': 9.736844062805176}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to create a JSON object for the capital of France, which is Paris. I remember that JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a way to represent data structures in a readable format. The user provided an example with fields like \"Name,\" \"Population,\" \"FoundingYear,\" and \"Coordinates.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll start by identifying all the key pieces of information about Paris. I know the name is Paris, so that's straightforward. The population is a dynamic figure, so I'll need to include the most recent estimate. I think it's around 2.1 million, but I should check if that's accurate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the founding year of Paris. I recall that it was established by Napoleon, but I'm not sure of the exact year. Maybe 1352? I should verify that. Then, the coordinates. Paris is located in France, so its country is France. The latitude and longitude are approximately 48.8566° N and 2.3522° E. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about other possible fields. Maybe \"OfficialLanguages\" since Paris is a multicultural city. The official languages include French, but are there others? I think English is also widely spoken. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in the example, they included \"Population,\" \"FoundingYear,\" and \"Coordinates.\" Maybe I should add \"OfficialLanguages\" for more information. That makes the data more comprehensive. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, structuring the JSON, I'll start with the basic fields. I'll set \"Name\" as \"Paris,\" \"Country\" as \"France,\" \"Population\" as an estimated number, \"FoundingYear\" as the year it was established, \"Coordinates\" with latitude and longitude, and \"OfficialLanguages\" including French and English. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should ensure the syntax is correct. Each key is in quotes, and the values are properly formatted. For numbers, I'll use integers or decimals, and strings will be in double quotes. Also, commas are important to separate each key-value pair except after the last one. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in the example, the population was listed as 2172000. Is that up to date? I should check a reliable source to confirm the current population estimate. Also, the founding year—I'm not entirely sure if it's 1352 or another year. Napoleon Bonaparte was the mayor of Paris from 1801 to 1815, so maybe the founding year is earlier, perhaps 1352 or 1353. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about the structure. Should I group related fields together? For example, maybe under a \"City\" object within the Paris entry? But the example didn't do that, so I'll keep it simple with direct key-value pairs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Including the official languages adds more information, making the JSON more informative. I'll make sure to list them as a list within the \"OfficialLanguages\" key. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there are any other fields that might be relevant, but since the example didn't include them, I'll stick to the ones provided. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll put it all together, making sure the JSON is correctly formatted without any syntax errors, like missing commas or incorrect brackets. Testing the JSON by converting it to JSON format or using a validator would be a good step, but since I can't do that right now, I'll be extra careful with the syntax.\n",
