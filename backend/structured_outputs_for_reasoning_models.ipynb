    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out how to get both the current date and time in New York and the weather there. Let me start by looking at the instructions given. <br><br>The user mentioned that I should always execute Python code in the messages I share. So, I need to make sure that any code I write is properly formatted and follows the specified structure. <br><br>Looking at the functions available, there are two relevant ones: `get_current_weather` and `get_current_date`. Each has specific parameters I need to provide. <br><br>First, for the date and time, I need to use `get_current_date`. The function requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I should provide the correct timezone string. New York is in the Eastern Time Zone, often abbreviated as 'America/New_York'. <br><br>Next, for the weather, I need to use `get_current_weather`. This function requires a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state is NY, and the unit should be either 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'. I'll choose 'fahrenheit' since that's the default unit and commonly used in the US.<br><br>I should structure my response by calling each function separately, as per the instructions. Each function call should be on its own line with the correct parameters in JSON format. <br><br>Wait, but the user's request is to get both pieces of information in one message. However, the guidelines say to call one function at a time. So I should address them one after the other.<br><br>Let me double-check the parameters. For `get_current_date`, the timezone is 'America/New_York'. For `get_current_weather`, city is 'New York', state is 'NY', and unit is 'fahrenheit'. <br><br>I should make sure to format the JSON correctly within the function call tags. Each function call should be within `<function=...>` tags with the parameters as a JSON object.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll first call `get_current_date` with the timezone parameter, then `get_current_weather` with the required city, state, and unit parameters. <br><br>Wait, but the user's message is a single request. Should I combine both in one message? The guidelines say to call one function at a time, so maybe I should split them into two separate messages. But the user's last message was a single request, so perhaps I should handle both in one response.<br><br>Hmm, maybe I should format it as two separate function calls within the same message, each on its own line. Or perhaps combine them into one, but that might complicate things. Since each function is separate, it's better to handle them one after the other.<br><br>So, the first function call will be for the date and time, and the second for the weather. Each will be on its own line with the appropriate parameters.<br><br>I think that's the way to go. I'll make sure to format each function call correctly, using the required parameters and the correct function names.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '57f3b216f4bf44e8883b63ebd3131ed4', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.718847751617432}}</strong>"

From what I know, as of the 2021 census, Paris had over 2 million residents. Let me confirm that number to ensure accuracy. \\n\\nYes, as of the latest data, the population is approximately 2,174,366. It\\'s important to present this information clearly. I should also format it in JSON, so I\\'ll structure it with keys for country, capital, and population.\\n\\nI\\'ll make sure the JSON is properly formatted, with proper syntax, and that the numbers are correct. No typos or missing commas. \\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be looking for data for a project or maybe just information they need for another purpose. By providing the exact figure, I\\'m ensuring they get a precise answer. \\n\\nI should double-check these numbers just to be sure. Maybe cross-referencing with recent sources to confirm the population figure. That way, the user gets a reliable and up-to-date piece of information.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for the user to read and use if needed.

      "First, I should check the latest data for the population. I know that populations can change every year, so it's best to look up the most recent figure. From what I remember, Paris has a population around 10 million, but I should verify that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe it's 8.6 million? I think I've heard that number before. I should double-check that to be accurate. Let me think... Yes, as of the latest estimates, Paris has a population of approximately 8,622,000 people. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, to format this correctly, the user wants it in JSON. So I'll structure it with a key \"capital\" and its value as \"Paris\". Then another key \"population\" with the number, making sure to include commas for thousands separators. \n",

      "I should also make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper quotation marks and braces. No trailing commas should be there to avoid errors. \n",
