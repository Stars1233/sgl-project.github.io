    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to generate information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I should recall what Paris is known for. It's the main city in France, right? I know it's a major cultural, economic, and political center. <br><br>I should probably start by listing the basic facts. The capital of France is Paris, so that's straightforward. The country it's the capital of is France, which I can confirm. The location is in the northern part of the country, near the Seine River. I remember that Paris is located in the Île-de-France region, which is a large area including other cities like Lyon and Marseille.<br><br>Next, I should think about the population. I think Paris is the second-largest city in France, after metropolitan Paris, which includes a much larger area. The population numbers might be around 2 million for the city proper and 8 million for the metropolitan area. I should double-check that, but I'm pretty sure that's correct.<br><br>Moving on to landmarks, the Eiffel Tower is a must. It's a symbol of the city and the country. The Louvre Museum is another famous landmark, one of the largest art museums in the world. The Paris Opera House is also iconic, especially for its architecture. The Arc de Triomphe is a significant historical monument, and Notre-Dame, despite the recent issues, is still a major attraction, though it's currently undergoing renovations.<br><br>I should include some key facts about Paris. It's known for its rich history, being the birthplace of many famous people like Victor Hugo, Ernest Hemingway, and others. It's also a global city with a vibrant cultural scene, hosting events like the French网球公开赛 and the Tour de France. The cuisine is a big part of its identity, with famous dishes like croissant and boeuf bourguignon.<br><br>Transportation is another area. Paris has an extensive public transportation system, including the Métro, which is a large subway network. The RER is another rail network that connects to other cities. Taxis are also a common mode of transportation, and there are bike lanes throughout the city, especially in the Île-de-France region.<br><br>I should structure this information into a JSON format. The JSON should have a key for the capital, which is \"Paris\", and then an object containing the details. I'll list each piece of information as a key-value pair under the \"capital\" key. I need to make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets, and that strings are enclosed in quotes.<br><br>Wait, I should also consider the population numbers. I think the population of Paris itself is around 2.1 million, while the metropolitan area is about 8.5 million. I should include that. Also, the area of Paris is approximately 105 square kilometers, and the metropolitan area is about 12,500 square kilometers.<br><br>I should also mention the time zone. Paris is in Central European Time (CET) during standard time and Central European Summer Time (CEST) in summer. That's important for international users.<br><br>Let me organize all this information into a JSON structure. I'll start with the capital key, then include the population, location, landmarks, key facts, transportation, and area. I'll make sure each key is descriptive and the values are accurate.<br><br>I think I've covered all the main points. Now, I'll format it correctly, ensuring that the JSON syntax is correct with proper commas and brackets. I'll avoid any markdown formatting as per the instructions and just present the JSON.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 214300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the information about the capital of France and present it in JSON format. Let me start by recalling what I know about Paris. I know it's the capital, but I should probably double-check that. Yeah, I'm pretty sure Paris is the administrative capital, but sometimes people might confuse it with other cities like Lyon or Marseille. But no, Paris is definitely the official capital.<br><br>Now, moving on to the population. I think Paris is a very large city, one of the biggest in the world. I remember reading somewhere that it's over 3 million people, but I'm not sure of the exact figure. Maybe around 3.5 million? I should look that up to be accurate, but since I'm just brainstorming, I'll go with that estimate.<br><br>Next, the area. Paris is a big city, but it's also a dense urban area. I think the metropolitan area covers a large region, maybe around 12,000 square kilometers? But the city proper is smaller. I'm not exactly sure, but I'll put 10,500 square kilometers for the city area and 12,000 for the metropolitan area.<br><br>Language is another point. Paris is a center for French culture, so the predominant language there is definitely French. I don't think they speak any other language there predominantly, though there might be some English, especially in tourist areas or with expatriates.<br><br>Cuisine is interesting. Paris is known for its high-end, fine dining, especially French cuisine. I know places like Le Faitout and others that are famous for their intricate dishes. Parisians are also known for their coffee culture, so maybe that's another point to include.<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has an extensive public transit system. The RER and地铁 are part of the BTP, which I think stands for Bahn, Tram, and Metro in German, but in French, it's the same. The city is well-connected by train, with major stations like Gare du Nord and Châtelet. The Eiffel Tower is a major landmark, and it's accessible by train from Paris.<br><br>I should also mention some of the main attractions. The Eiffel Tower is iconic, along with the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. These are must-see spots for tourists.<br><br>Now, putting this all together into JSON format. I'll structure it with an \"info\" key that contains a \"capital\" object with \"name,\" \"population,\" \"area,\" and \"language.\" Then, an \"attractions\" array that lists the main points of interest. I'll make sure the numbers are approximate since I don't have exact figures on hand.<br><br>Wait, I should check if the population is over 3 million or 3.5. I think it's around 3.5 million as of recent estimates. The area, I'm pretty sure the metropolitan area is about 12,000 km², and the city proper is a bit less, maybe 10,500 km².

So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. Yeah, that sounds right. I also remember that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, and it's a symbol of the country. So if Paris is the capital, then that makes sense.

      "{'text': 'Okay, so I need to provide the information about the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, I\\'m not entirely sure about all the details, but I\\'ll try to think it through.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty much a given, right? But I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall any other capitals I know. London is the capital of the UK, Rome is Italy, and maybe Tokyo is Japan\\'s. Yeah, Paris seems correct for France.\\n\\nNow, moving on to the population. I think Paris is a very large city, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I remember it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not certain. Maybe around 3.5 million? I should probably look that up, but since I can\\'t right now, I\\'ll go with 3,500,000 as an estimate.\\n\\nNext, the area. Paris is a big city, but I think it\\'s not as large as Tokyo or London. Maybe around 10 square kilometers? I\\'m not sure, but that seems plausible. I\\'ll note that as 10,000,000 square meters.\\n\\nCoordinates are next. Paris is in France, so the country code is \"FR\". The latitude and longitude... I think the approximate coordinates are around 48.8566° N latitude and 2.3522° E longitude. I remember that Paris is in the northern and eastern parts of France, so those should be correct.\\n\\nOfficial languages. France is a country with a lot of languages, but I think French is the official language. I\\'m not sure if they have others, but French is definitely the primary one. Maybe they also have some other languages spoken there, but I\\'ll stick with French for now.\\n\\nOfficial currency is the euro, right? Yeah, I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s correct. They use the euro as their main currency.\\n\\nI should also consider if there\\'s anything else I might need to include. Maybe the capital\\'s nickname? I think Paris is called the \"City of Light\" or something like that. But the user didn\\'t ask for that, so maybe it\\'s not necessary.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with the key-value pairs. The keys should be in English, and the values can be numbers, strings, or maybe even objects if needed. Since the population and area are numerical, I\\'ll represent them as numbers. The rest can be strings.\\n\\nWait, but in JSON, numbers don\\'t have commas, right? So 3,500,000 should be written as 3500000 without the comma. Same with the area, 10,000,000 square meters becomes 10000000.\\n\\nLet me make sure I\\'m formatting the JSON correctly. The keys should be in double quotes, and the values can be numbers or strings. So the structure would be something like:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"area\": 10000000,\\n  \"country\": \"FR\",\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n  },\\n  \"languages\": \"French\",\\n  \"currency\": \"Euro\"\\n}\\n\\nWait, but the coordinates are just two numbers, so maybe I don\\'t need a nested object. So it would be:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"area\": 10000000,\\n  \"country\": \"FR\",\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n  },\\n  \"languages\": \"French\",\\n  \"currency\": \"Euro\"\\n}\\n\\nThat looks better. I think that\\'s all the information I need. I should make sure that the numerical values don\\'t have commas and that the strings are in double quotes. Also, the keys should be in lowercase letters as per JSON standards.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve covered everything. Population and area are estimates, but they\\'re close enough for a general JSON format. I don\\'t think I need to include more details unless specified. So, this should be the correct JSON structure for the information about the capital of France.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000', 'meta_info': {'id': 'b6042b1a288f421b88ced3087023c9aa', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'length', 'length': 2048}, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 2048, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 20.096238136291504}}\n"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the derivative of a function, right? Let me see. The function is f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5. I remember from class that to find the derivative, I need to use the power rule. \\n\\nAlright, the power rule says that if I have a function like x^n, its derivative is n*x^(n-1). So, applying that to each term of the function should give me the derivative. Let\\'s break it down term by term.\\n\\nFirst term: 3x^2. The exponent is 2, so I bring that down as a coefficient, multiply it by 3, which gives me 6. Then, I reduce the exponent by 1, so it becomes x^(2-1) = x^1, which is just x. So, the derivative of 3x^2 is 6x.\\n\\nSecond term: 2x. The exponent here is 1 because x is the same as x^1. Applying the power rule, I bring down the 1 as a coefficient, multiply it by 2, which gives me 2. Then, reduce the exponent by 1, so it becomes x^(1-1) = x^0, which is 1. So, the derivative of 2x is 2.\\n\\nThird term: -5. This is a constant term. I remember that the derivative of a constant is zero because there\\'s no change as x changes. So, the derivative of -5 is 0.\\n\\nNow, putting it all together, the derivative of f(x) should be 6x + 2. Wait, let me double-check. The first term\\'s derivative is 6x, the second is 2, and the third is 0. So, yes, adding them up gives 6x + 2.\\n\\nI think that\\'s it. But just to be sure, maybe I should plug in a value for x and see if the derivative makes sense. Let\\'s say x = 1. The original function f(1) = 3(1)^2 + 2(1) - 5 = 3 + 2 - 5 = 0. The derivative at x=1 is 6(1) + 2 = 8. So, at the point (1,0), the slope of the tangent line should be 8. That seems reasonable.\\n\\nAnother check: x = 0. f(0) = 3(0)^2 + 2(0) -5 = -5. The derivative at x=0 is 6(0) + 2 = 2. So, the slope at (0,-5) is 2. That also makes sense because the function is a parabola opening upwards, so the slope at the vertex (which is at x = -b/(2a) = -2/(6) = -1/3) should be zero. Wait, but at x=0, it\\'s 2. Hmm, maybe I should calculate the slope at x = -1/3. Let\\'s see, f\\'(-1/3) = 6*(-1/3) + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0. Yes, that\\'s correct. So, the derivative at x=0 is 2, which is positive, meaning the function is increasing there, which aligns with the parabola\\'s shape.\\n\\nI think I\\'m confident now. The derivative is 6x + 2.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"StepbyStepSolution\",\\n\"population\": 1000000000\\n\\n\\n  \\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n \\t\\t}', 'meta_info': {'id': '072d43e6192840e4a64c10c35021d6b0', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 5, 'completion_tokens': 790, 'cached_tokens': 2, 'e2e_latency': 8.279677629470825}}</strong>"

All of Paris, including the Île-de-France region, uses French as the primary language.\\n\\n moved annually? I believe that on average, about 300,000 people move into Paris each year. This number includes both residents moving out and new arrivals.\\n\\nIn terms of transportation, Paris is known for its extensive public transit system. The RATP operates the subway, trams, andville stations, covering a large portion of the city. There are also methodologies for the metro and the RER for quick lines. The city center is well-connected with buses, which are a popular mode of transport, especially during rush hours.\\n\\nEconomically, Paris is a major hub. It\\'s home to many international companies, financial institutions, and a large business district. The GDP is significant, placing it among the top economies globally.\\n\\nCulturally, Paris is rich in museums, art, and historical sites. The Louvre,阜阳, the Eiffel Tower, and the Musée d\\'Orsay are some of the most famous attractions. France is also known for its cuisine, with popular dishes like croissant, baguette, and baguette.\\n\\nFestivals and events are a big part of Paris\\'s culture. I know about the Bastille Day, which is a major holiday celebrated on July 14th. Also, Versailles is a nearby city with its own historical significance and beautiful gardens.\\n\\nCuisine-wise, Paris is famous for its baguette, croissant, and Bouchon bread. Frenchภาค throwing is another thing, but I\\'m not entirely sure about the details.\\n\\nAs for notable landmarks, besides the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, there\\'s also Notre-Dame, though it\\'s had some issues with repairs.\\n\\nDemographically, Paris is the second-largest city in France after metropolitan Paris, but the metropolitan area is bigger because it includes Île-de-France. So I should mention that Paris proper doesn\\'t exceed 700,000 inhabitants, while Île-de-France\\'s population is much higher at around 12 million.\\n\\nThe historical background includes its role in the French Revolution, as it was the center of the revolution and the location where the king and queen were executed. \\n\\nTravel-wise, Paris is easily accessible by air, with CDG being the main international airport. Trains, buses, and the metro are also convenient options for travelers.\\n\\nThe climate is temperate, with mild winters and hot, sunny summers. Average temperatures range from about 2°C to 20°C in winter and 18°C to 32°C in summer.\\n\\nCuisine is a significant aspect, so I should highlight the variety of restaurants, street food, and the famous Michelin-starred Reqis. There are also international cuisine festivals each year, attracting both locals and tourists.\\n\\nIn terms of multiples, I know that when it comes to population, Île-de-France is one of the most populous regions in Europe, with a population exceeding 12 million.\\n\\nFinally, Paris is a cultural, economic, and political center of France, known for its universities,interactive art installations, and music scene.\\n\\nI think that covers the main points about Paris. I should now organize all this information into a proper JSON format, making sure each key is correctly labeled and the data is accurate.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the JSON representation of information about the capital of France, Paris:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"region\": \"Île-de-France\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"paris_proper\": \"Approx. 2.2-2.4 million\",\\n    \"ile_de_france\": \"Approx. 12.5 million\"\\n  },\\n  \"language\": \"French\",\\n  \"average_annual_movers\": \"Approx. 300,000\",\\n  \"transportation\": {\\n    \"subway\": \"RATP\",\\n    \"trams\": \"Various\",\\n    \"chefes-lignes\": \"Numbered lines\",\\n    \"city_center\": \"Well-connected\",\\n    \"buses\": \"Popular during rush hours\"\\n  },\\n  \"economy\": \"Major economic hub with many international companies and financial institutions\",\\n  \"culture\": {\\n    \"museums\": [\"Louvre\", \"Musée d\\'Orsay\"],\\n    \" landmarks\": [\"Eiffel Tower\", \"Notre-Dame\"],\\n    \"holidays\": [\"Bastille Day (July 14)\"],\\n    \"gardens\": [\"Versailles Palace Gardens\"]\\n  },\\n  \"culinary\": {\\n    \"famous_recipes\": [\"Croissant\", \"Baguette\"],\\n    \"famous_restaurants\": [\"Bouchon Bread\", \"Paillot Bistro\"],\\n    \"fests\": [\"French parades\", \"International Bouchon Festival\"],\\n    \"special_cuisine\": [\"Baguette throwing\"]\\n  },\\n  \"history\": {\\n    \"revolution tied\": \"Center of the French Revolution, executed King Charles and Queen Marie\",\\n    \"landmarks\": [\"Monsieur le Barside\"]\\n  },\\n  \"travel\": {\\n    \"airports\": [\"CDG\"],\\n    \"transport_options\": [\"Train\", \"Bus\", \"Metro\"],\\n    \"location\": \"Central location in France\"\\n  },\\n  \"climate\": {\\n    \"weather\": [\"Temperate\", \"Mild winters (2-20°C)\", \"Hot summers (18-32°C)\"]\\n  },\\n  \"multiples\": {\\n    \"population\": \" Île-de-France is Europe\\'s most populous region with over 12 million residents\"\\n  },\\n  \"other\": \"Cultural, economic, and political center; known for universities, interactive art, and music\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON format encapsulates various aspects of Paris, from basic demographics and infrastructure to cultural and economic highlights, providing a comprehensive overview.', 'meta_info': {'id': 'aff1dd2bf9e84236bcb4850a1add7d4f', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 1339, 'cached_tokens': 19, 'e2e_latency': 13.58064603805542}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to create a JSON object about the capital of France, which is Paris. I remember that Paris is the main city where the Eiffel Tower is located, but I'm not entirely sure about all the details. Let me think about what information I should include. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, the basic details: name, nickname, location. Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. The Eiffel Tower is right there, so that's a good point. Maybe also the date it was built. I think it was built in the 19th century, perhaps 1889? Not entirely sure, but I'll go with that for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, languages spoken. Paris is a global city, so I should include French as the main language. Maybe also mention that English is widely understood. I'm not sure if other languages are spoken there, but I'll note that French is the primary language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cuisine is another area. Paris is famous for its food, like baguettes, croissants, and wine. I should include that. Maybe also something about French cuisine, like regional dishes or chef names.\n",
      "\n",
      "History-wise, Paris has a rich past. The Parisian Opera was the first public opera, established in 1716. The Haussmann era, which was the 19th-century urban renewal, is significant too. The Eiffel Tower was built during that time. Also, Paris is known as the \"City of Light\" because of its numerous bridges over the Seine River.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transportation in Paris is efficient. They have the Metro, buses, and trams. The RATP is the public transportation authority, I believe. Maybe also mention the Paris airports, like Charles de Gaulle and Orly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tourist attractions are a big part of Paris. The Louvre is a must-see, as is the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. Notre-Dame, though it's had some issues, is another iconic site. The Seine River itself, along with its bridges and canals, is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accommodation options are diverse. There are luxury hotels like the Ritz, mid-range options, and budget hotels. Paris is also known for student housing and co-working spaces, which is a good point for young people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cultural aspects include its status as a World Heritage Site, being a=listed in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. It's also known as the \"City of Light\" as I mentioned before. The culture scene with theaters like Théâtre du Faris and ballet companies is worth noting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Festivals and events are a big part of Paris's life. The French summer is especially vibrant with events like Bastille Day, and in winter, there's the Tour de France bike race. The city is also the capital of France, so political significance is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Geographical features include the Seine River, which flows through the city. The Eiffel Tower is a key landmark. The Haussmann modifications are another notable feature, as they transformed Paris's urban landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, did I miss anything? Let me go through the initial list again. I think I covered all the main points. Maybe add that Paris is known for its fashion scene with places like Galeries Laguerre. Also, mention the Paris Agreement, which relates to climate change efforts, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Probably better to stick to more general info.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also check if all the dates are correct. The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889, which is correct. The Parisian Opera started in 1716, that's right. Haussmann started in 1843 and finished in 1851, so that's accurate. The Louvre was opened in 1785, correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've covered all the key points. Now, I just need to structure them into a JSON object with the correct keys and values. I'll make sure each key is in quotes and the values are properly formatted. Also, the value for languages should be an array, same with transportation and attractions. The rest can be strings or arrays as appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me double-check the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors. Indentation isn't required in JSON, but it's good for readability. I'll make sure commas are placed correctly, not at the end of arrays or objects.\n",
      "\n",
