    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

They mentioned they're in New York and want the current date and time, along with the weather. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, the user is asking for two things: current date/time and current weather. So I should probably use two different functions for each part.<br><br>For the date and time, I remember there's a function called get_current_date. It requires a timezone parameter. The user is in New York, so the timezone should be 'America/New_York'. I'll need to structure the function call correctly, making sure to include the timezone argument.<br><br>Next, for the weather, the function get_current_weather is available. This function needs a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state is NY, and the unit should be Fahrenheit since the user didn't specify otherwise. I should make sure all these parameters are included in the function call.<br><br>I should also remember to format each function call properly. Each should start with <function= followed by the function name and the parameters in a JSON object. Then, close it with </function>. Also, I need to include the source for each function call, so I'll add a comment with the function name and a brief description.<br><br>Wait, do I need to call both functions in one message? The user said to use the functions as specified, so I think it's better to handle each request separately. That way, the user can see both pieces of information clearly.<br><br>Let me make sure I'm not missing any parameters. For get_current_date, only the timezone is needed. For get_current_weather, city, state, and unit are required. I have all those covered.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write two separate function calls: one for the date/time and another for the weather. Each will have their own start and end tags with the necessary parameters.<br><br>I should also ensure that the parameters are in a JSON format within the function calls. No markdown, just plain text with the correct syntax.<br><br>So, the final response should look like two separate function calls, each properly formatted with their respective parameters and sources. That should fully address the user's request accurately.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'fb02866754534067bd86f08ff4e7fe5e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.921405792236328}}</strong>"

I know that Paris is the capital city, but I\\'m not entirely sure about the exact population number. I\\'ve heard it mentioned a few times in the news, like around 2 million maybe? Wait, that sounds a bit low. I think it\\'s actually larger than that. Let me try to remember if I\\'ve heard it around 2.2 million or something closer to 2.1 million.\\n\\nI should also consider if the population figure is up to date. Population numbers can change every year, so maybe the latest estimate is a bit different. I think recent estimates have put it around 2.2 million, but I\\'m not 100% certain. It would be good to include a range or a note about the estimate to be accurate.\\n\\nI should structure this information in a JSON format as requested. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll use \"capital\" as the key for the city and \"population\" for the number. Since I\\'m not 100% confident about the exact number, I can provide it as an estimate around 2.1-2.2 million. That way, it\\'s clear that it\\'s an approximate figure.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have two keys with their respective values. I should make sure the syntax is correct, using quotation marks for keys and string values, and the appropriate symbols for commas and braces. Also, since populations can vary and it\\'s an estimate, it\\'s good to mention that it\\'s approximate in the value part.\\n\\nWait, is there any chance that the capital might have changed? I don\\'t think so. After Napoleon, Paris remained the capital, so it shouldn\\'t have changed. Therefore, Paris is definitely the capital, and the population is an estimate around 2.1-2.2 million.\\n\\nSo, to summarize, the JSON structure will have \"capital\": \"Paris\" and \"population\": \"2.1-2.2 million\". I think this covers all the necessary information clearly and accurately.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": \"2.1-2.2 million\"\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'a44a3b2eb9b5402e8c43cf4fa805b0cd', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 469, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.394760608673096}}</strong>"
