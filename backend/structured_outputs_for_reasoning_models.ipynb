    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Alright, so the user is asking for the current date and time in New York and the weather there. Let me break this down. They mentioned New York, so I need to figure out the correct timezone for that. New York is often associated with Eastern Time, which is UTC-5, but it can vary depending on daylight saving time. However, since the user didn't specify a date, I should probably go with the standard Eastern Time without daylight saving.<br><br>Next, for the date and time, I can use the get_current_date function. I'll set the timezone parameter to 'America/New_York'. That should give me the most accurate current date and time based on when the user is asking.<br><br>Now, for the weather. The user also wants the current weather in New York. I'll use the get_current_weather function here. I need to provide the city as 'New York' and the state as 'NY' since that's the two-letter abbreviation. The unit isn't specified, but since the user didn't mention a preference, I'll default to Celsius, which is a common unit used widely.<br><br>Wait a second, I should make sure that both functions are called correctly. The get_current_date function requires only the timezone parameter, so I'll structure that part properly. For get_current_weather, I need to include city, state, and unit as parameters. I'll format the JSON accordingly, making sure the keys and values are correctly paired.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write the function calls one after the other, ensuring each is within its own set of start and end tags. I'll also add sources to both function calls to show where the information is coming from. That should cover everything the user is asking for.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"celsius\"}</function></strong>"

I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see... Yes, according to the latest data, the population is approximately 2,174,300 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \"country\". The city is Paris, the population is the number I found, and the country is France.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. The entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. I\\'ll format it properly to avoid any syntax errors.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have the city, population, and country. I\\'ll present this to the user, making sure it\\'s clear and easy to understand. I don\\'t think the user needs anything more detailed, so this should suffice.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need additional information, like the area or age distribution, but since they only asked for population, I\\'ll stick to that. Maybe they\\'ll ask for more details later, but for now, this response should be helpful.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '8189d5e0ca6a4db4bfe3b1cb7cdbc045', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 384, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.4863088130950928}}</strong>"

Maybe they\\'re building a data structure for a project or just doing some quick research. Since they specified JSON, they probably need this information in a structured format that\\'s easy to parse, like for integration into an app or a report they\\'re working on.\\n\\nI should make sure the information is accurate. The capital of France is definitely Paris. Now, about the population. I know Paris is the largest city in France, but has it grown over the years? I\\'ll check the latest data. From recent sources, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 21 million people. It\\'s a good number to provide, but I should mention that the figure might fluctuate based on the source and the year.\\n\\nThey might be interested in knowing whether the data is exact or just an average. Including that it\\'s an approximate figure could be helpful. Maybe they don\\'t realize the population can change due to births, deaths, and migration. Adding that might give them a more accurate picture.\\n\\nAdditionally, if they\\'re using this data for something like urban planning or city demographics, they might need the exact number, so providing the note that it\\'s approximate could prevent confusion. I should present the information clearly, keeping it concise but thorough. The JSON format should be valid, so I\\'ll structure it with a \"capital\" key and a \"population\" key.\\n\\nI don\\'t think they need the full name spelled out; just Paris should suffice. Also, considering if they might need the population for the metropolitan area or just the city center. But since the capital is the city, I\\'ll assume they want the city population.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the response should be straightforward, accurate, and formatted as a JSON object with the necessary details.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 21035000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object contains the capital city of France and its population.', 'meta_info': {'id': '4db8a0c513b44ae683476377ff685fc8', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 432, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.9115216732025146}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Alright, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First off, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I'm pretty sure it's Paris, but I should double-check to be sure. Yes, Paris is definitely the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to find the most recent population data for Paris. Population figures can change every year, so I'll look for the latest statistics available. I remember reading that the population was around 2 million in recent years, but I should verify the exact number. A quick search tells me that as of 2023, Paris had a population of approximately 2,155,347 people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user specifically asked for this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a way to structure data in a readable format. I'll need to format the population number correctly, making sure it's a numerical value and not a string. Also, I should present it in a clear and concise JSON structure so that it's easy for the user to understand and use if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll create a JSON object with the key \"capital\" and its value as \"Paris\", and another key \"population\" with the number 2155347. I'll make sure the syntax is correct, using quotation marks and proper commas to separate the keys and values.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there's any additional information the user might find useful, but since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. Maybe in the future, the user could ask for more details, but for now, this response is sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no typos or formatting issues. It's important that the data is accurate and well-structured so the user can easily access the information without any problems.\n",
