    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I remember it's over 3 million, but I'm not certain if it's 3.5 or 3.6. I should double-check that.<br><br>Next, I thought about the structure. The user wants JSON, so I need to format it correctly with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\". I should make sure the syntax is correct—no typos, proper commas, and brackets. <br><br>I also considered the user's possible needs. They might be doing a project or a presentation, so providing accurate data is crucial. Maybe they're a student learning about France's capitals or someone compiling demographic data. Either way, precision is key.<br><br>I decided to present the information clearly, ensuring the JSON is valid and easy to read. I included the population as 3.617 million, which I believe is the most recent figure I could recall.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

No, I'm pretty sure France's capital is Paris. Maybe I should double-check that to be certain. Yeah, Paris is where the government is located, and that's the capital.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. \\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I\\'ll stick to that. \\n\\nLastly, I\\'ll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '424d6884885b459eb2c636a14c11b981', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 412, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 3.807537794113159}}\n"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. <br><br>Next, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

Now, I should probably include not just the population but maybe other key information as well.\\n\\nI know Paris is the capital, so I\\'ll include the location, which is in Île-de-France, France. The prefecture is 75001, and it\\'s Île-de-France\\'s main city. I should note that Paris is a global city, which adds some context.\\n\\nNow, for the population. I should mention that the population is approximate. As of 2023, it\\'s around 3.5 million. Also, Paris is a very diverse city with many ethnic groups. That gives a bit more depth.\\n\\nSince the user asked for JSON, I\\'ll structure it with key-value pairs. Including all the information I thought of, in a readable format. I should make sure it\\'s properly formatted so they can easily parse it.\\n\\nI\\'ll double-check the information for accuracy. Population figures can change, so it\\'s good to mention it\\'s an estimate. The ethnic diversity is a nice addition that shows the multifaceted nature of the city.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should be clean and concise, covering location, prefecture, status, population, and diversity. That should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"location\": \" Île-de-France, France\",\\n    \"prefecture\": \"75001\",\\n    \"status\": \"The City of Light and the Parismetre\",\\n    \"population\": \"Approximately 3.5 million (as of 2023 estimates)\",\\n    \"ethnic_diversity\": \"A multicultural city with a diverse population, including French, African, Asian, and immigrant communities.\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'b0e70cd325734b658c25d4b7b47bb12d', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 436, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.8746464252471924}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, I need to make sure I provide accurate and up-to-date data. Let me think about how to approach this.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the capital of France is definitely Paris. That's a given. Now, the population. I remember reading that Paris has a large population, but it's not as straightforward as just a single figure. The population can vary depending on the source and the time of the year because people move in and out for different reasons, like tourism or seasonal work.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should check the most recent data available. From what I know, the population is over 2 million. But I think it's around 2.1 to 2.2 million. I should verify that. Wait, I think it's currently around 2,150,000. But to be precise, maybe it's a bit higher now. I recall that population figures can fluctuate, so it's important to present it accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the user asked for JSON format, I need to structure it properly. The JSON should include the country, city, population, and maybe the year of the data. That way, it's clear and organized. I should also note that the population is approximate because exact numbers can change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON structure should have a key for \"country,\" the value \"France\"; \"city\" with the population; and perhaps a \"note\" about the data being approximate. I need to make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should double-check the population number to ensure it's the most current. Maybe look up the latest census or official statistics from the French National Institute of Statistics and Studies. Wait, I think the population was around 2,150,000 as of 2023, but it's growing. So, perhaps 2,170,000 now. However, without the exact current figure, it's safer to use an approximate value with a note.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, I think I've got all the necessary information. Time to format it into JSON, making sure it's clean and easy to read. Also, I should remind the user that the population can vary, so it's always a good idea to check the latest sources for the most accurate data.\n",
