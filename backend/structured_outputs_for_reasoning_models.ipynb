    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

I should probably use both of them. <br><br>Starting with the date, the function 'get_current_date' requires a timezone parameter. The user mentioned New York, so I should use the 'America/New_York' timezone code. That makes sense because it's specific enough to get the local date and time.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I'll call 'get_current_weather'. I need the city and state. The city is New York, and the state is NY since it's abbreviation for New York. The unit isn't specified, but I can choose either 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'. Since many people are more familiar with Fahrenheit, I'll go with that.<br><br>I need to structure the response correctly. The user example showed how to format the function calls, so I'll follow that. Each function call should be on its own line with the correct parameters in JSON format. <br><br>I should also make sure to include the sources where I got the information, but since I'm using predefined functions, I don't need external data. So, I'll add a note that the information is based on these functions.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write the two function calls with the appropriate parameters.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'f223e7dfb1184aa8ad1d8a3a25577dac', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.654881238937378}}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out what they really want. They want the information about the capital, which is Paris, and specifically its population. But they want it in JSON format, which is a data structure used in programming.\\n\\nI should make sure I have the correct and up-to-date population figure. I know the population of Paris is around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe recent years have slight changes, so I might look up the latest data to be accurate.\\n\\nAlso, the user didn\\'t specify if they want just Paris or the population of France as a whole. Since they mentioned the capital specifically, I think it\\'s safer to focus on Paris unless I can confirm it\\'s about the entire country. Given the context, I\\'ll go with Paris.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON object. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll need a key like \"capital\" and \"population\" with the appropriate values. Ensuring the formatting is correct is important to avoid errors if they use this data elsewhere.\\n\\nI should also format the number properly, maybe using commas for readability, like 2,016,000 instead of 2016000. That makes it easier to read.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present it in a clear and concise manner, making sure the JSON is properly enclosed in curly braces and each key is in quotes. I\\'ll end with a friendly note asking if I need further details to ensure I\\'m meeting their needs.\\n</think>\\n\\nCertainly! Here is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2016600\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object contains the capital of France and its population.

      "I should include the name of the city, which is obviously Paris. Then, the population. Hmm, I remember that Paris has a dynamic population because of its frequent events and tourism, so the number might change. As of the latest data I have, it's around 2.2 million. But I should note that it's an approximate figure and can vary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, maybe adding some key facts about Paris would be helpful. Like, it's a global city, the political and cultural center, home to significant landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, and that it's known for its cuisine. These points give a more comprehensive view.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON format is correct—proper keys like \"Name,\" \"Population,\" and \"Key_Facts.\" Each should be a string, and the population can be a number. I'll format it neatly so it's easy to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include any units for the population? Probably not necessary since JSON doesn't enforce units. But including it could make it clearer, so I'll add \"2,200,000\" as the population number and mention that it's approximate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me double-check the facts to ensure accuracy. Paris is indeed the capital, it's known for the Eiffel Tower, and has a rich cultural history with the Louvre. The culinary aspect is spot on too—bouillons and baguettes are popular. I think this covers the user's query adequately.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure the JSON syntax is correct—proper commas, quotes, and brackets. Any mistake there could cause issues if someone tries to parse it. So, I'll structure it with proper indentation for readability.\n",
