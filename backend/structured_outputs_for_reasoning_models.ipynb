    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is currently in New York and wants to know both the current date and time as well as the weather. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I need to figure out how to get the current date and time. The user mentioned New York, which is in the Eastern Time Zone. I should use the 'get_current_date' function for this. The function requires a timezone parameter. Since New York is EST in winter and EDT in summer, but for the current date and time, it's better to use 'America/New_York' as the timezone parameter. I'll structure this as {\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"} and wrap it in the function call.<br><br>Next, the user also wants the weather. Since they're in New York, I can use the 'get_current_weather' function. This function needs city, state, and unit. The city is \"New York\", the state is \"NY\" because that's the two-letter abbreviation, and the unit should be Fahrenheit since the user didn't specify, so I'll default to 'fahrenheit'. The parameters will be {\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}.<br><br>Now, I have to format both function calls correctly. Each function call should be on its own line, with the function name and parameters in the specified JSON format. So, I'll first call get_current_date with the timezone parameter, then immediately follow it with get_current_weather with the city, state, and unit parameters.<br><br>I also need to make sure that each function is called correctly, using the right syntax and including all required parameters. The example provided by the user showed how to structure each function call, so I'll follow that exactly.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll have two separate function calls: one for the date and time, and another for the weather, each properly formatted with their respective parameters.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '09adb8a02c2a4f4792e926c6255331e7', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.771729230880737}}</strong>"

I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the city in question. I remember it\\'s located in Île-de-France, which ties into the Sorbonne, a significant university there. \\n\\nNext, I should think about the population. I\\'m pretty sure the population is around 2 million. But wait, I think it\\'s actually a bit higher. Maybe around 2,100,000? Or perhaps a touch over that. I want to make sure I get the number right to provide the most accurate information.\\n\\nThe user also mentioned a JSON format, so I should structure the response accordingly. They likely want a clear and concise data structure, probably a JSON array with a single element. Each key should correspond to relevant information: name, location, notable institutions, and population.\\n\\nI\\'ll start by listing the basic facts: name and location. Then, I\\'ll include that it\\'s a global city. Adding the Sorbonne makes sense to highlight a significant landmark. The population data is crucial, so I\\'ll verify the exact figure. I think it\\'s approximately 2,108,663 as of the latest estimates.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should provide a comprehensive yet straightforward overview. I\\'ll make sure the fields are clear and each piece of information is accurate. This way, the user gets all the necessary details in an easy-to-understand format.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"location\": \"Île-de-France\",\\n    \"notable_institution\": \"Sorbonne University\",\\n    \"population\": 2108663\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'dde0376b86574120bac062241583ac0e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 392, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.295559644699097}}</strong>"
