    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '6d367f81795f41649b7477b6ff346c6b', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.046622276306152}}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out what exactly they\\'re asking for. They want the JSON structure, so I should make sure to format the response accordingly. But wait, they mentioned both \"information\" and \"population.\" I wonder if they specifically want just the population or if \"information\" means more details about the capital.\\n\\nSo, the capital of France is Paris. I should confirm that to ensure accuracy. Yes, Paris is definitely the capital. Now, I need to find the latest population stats. I recall that as of 2023, Paris had a population of around 11 million. Let me double-check that to be sure. \\n\\nI\\'ll search the data base to confirm the numbers. Yes, according to the latest sources, the population is approximately 11,218,500 as of 2023. I should present this in a clear JSON structure, following the example the user provided. They used key-value pairs, so I\\'ll stick with that format.\\n\\nI should also make sure the response is concise and to the point. Maybe they\\'re using this data for a project or a quick reference, so clarity is key. I\\'ll format it with proper JSON syntax, including commas and brackets correctly to avoid any errors.\\n\\nWait, the user also mentioned the population in the initial response. Did they mean Paris or France as a whole? Since they specifically asked for the capital, Paris, it\\'s safer to focus on that. But I should also clarify to prevent any confusion, just in case they meant the country\\'s total population.\\n\\nAlso, thinking about the user\\'s possible intent, they might be a student, researcher, or maybe someone working on a demographics-related project. They might need this data for a report or presentation. So, providing accurate and up-to-date information is crucial.\\n\\nI should also consider if there\\'s any other information the user might implicitly need, like the location of the capital, some key facts, or maybe even historical population data. But since they specified \"information\" and \"population,\" I\\'ll stick to what\\'s requested unless they ask for more.\\n\\nIn the response, I\\'ll structure it with \"Capital\" key containing the city and country, and \"Population\" key with the number. Making sure the JSON is valid, I\\'ll format it correctly without any typos to prevent parsing errors.\\n\\nI think that\\'s it. The user\\'s query is pretty straightforward, so the response should be direct and provide the necessary data clearly. I\\'ll make sure to present it neatly with a brief explanation, perhaps letting them know that the population figure is current as of 2023.\\n</think>\\n\\nSure! Here is the information about the capital of France and its population in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"location\": \"France\"\\n  },\\n  \"population\": 11218500\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object contains the capital of France (Paris), its location, and its population.', 'meta_info': {'id': 'f5c84a4881c546759674a561b5506288', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 648, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.100303411483765}}</strong>"
