    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",
    "- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see... Yes, according to the latest data, the population is approximately 2,174,300 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \"country\". The city is Paris, the population is the number I found, and the country is France.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. The entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. I\\'ll format it properly to avoid any syntax errors.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have the city, population, and country. I\\'ll present this to the user, making sure it\\'s clear and easy to understand. I don\\'t think the user needs anything more detailed, so this should suffice.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need additional information, like the area or age distribution, but since they only asked for population, I\\'ll stick to that. Maybe they\\'ll ask for more details later, but for now, this response should be helpful.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'cd7491d9f9854a48a59c15ad652a8fdf', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 384, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.7998290061950684}}</strong>"

First, I need to figure out which city is the capital. France\\'s capital is Paris, so that\\'s my focus.\\n\\nNext, I should gather the necessary data. I\\'ll need the population number. I remember it\\'s approximately 3.5 million, but I should verify that the latest data supports that figure. Maybe I can reference recent sources or databases to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nI should also consider any additional details that might be useful, like the country\\'s population for context. That way, the JSON isn\\'t too sparse. Including the country\\'s population gives a better sense of scale.\\n\\nThinking about the structure, JSON requires keys and values. I\\'ll structure it as \"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 3500000, \"country_population\": \"X\". Filling in \"country_population\" with the current French population figure is important for completeness.\\n\\nI need to make sure the JSON is correctly formatted. Proper indentation and commas are crucial to avoid errors. Double-checking for any typos or formatting issues will ensure the response is reliable.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present this information in a clear response, perhaps adding a sentence that parses the data for clarity, making it easier for anyone reading the JSON to understand.\\n\\nI should also be cautious about any potential update dates since population numbers change yearly. Maybe I should note that the population figure is approximate to avoid giving outdated or incorrect information.\\n\\nOverall, the goal is to provide a clear, accurate, and well-structured JSON response that meets the user\\'s request effectively.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"country_population\": \"67,333,000 (approximate as of recent data)\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON contains:\\n- The name of the capital: \"Paris\"\\n- An estimated population of the capital: 3,500,000\\n- The approximate population of the country (France) for context: 67,333,000.', 'meta_info': {'id': 'fb1cf8bd86704a4382f0f11019a9afbf', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 462, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.353617191314697}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's request. They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I should determine what exactly the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's the city they're referring to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need the population figure. I'm not exactly sure about the current number, but I remember that the population is around 2 million. However, I should make sure if that's accurate. I think in recent years, Paris has grown a bit, so maybe it's a little more than that. Maybe around 2.1 or 2.2 million? I should double-check that, but since I can't access the internet, I'll stick with the commonly cited figure of approximately 2.1 million as of 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON is a data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. So, I need to structure the data accordingly. The JSON format typically uses key-value pairs within curly braces. I'll create an object with a \"city\" key and assign \"Paris\" to it. Then, a \"population\" key with the number I found.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also include a message to indicate that the data is as of a certain year, which adds context about the accuracy of the population figure. That way, the user knows that the population might have changed since then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON structure will have a root object with the city and population keys, and a message string. I need to make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks, so that when the user parses this JSON, it works without errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if the user might need more detailed information, like population growth trends or other statistics, but since they only asked for the population of the capital, I'll stick to that. It's possible they might have additional needs, but without further queries, I should limit the response to the information requested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll format the response clearly, making sure each key is properly labeled and the data is concise. This way, the user gets a straightforward and accurate answer in the format they requested.\n",
