    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",
    "- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to generate information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I should recall what Paris is known for. It's the main city in France, right? I know it's a major cultural, economic, and political center. <br><br>I should probably start by listing the basic facts. Paris is the capital, so I'll note that. Then, I remember it's located in the northern part of the country, in the Île-de-France region. The coordinates are something like 48°51′N 2°28′E, but I'm not sure about the exact minutes and seconds. Maybe I should look that up, but since I'm just brainstorming, I'll approximate it.<br><br>Next, Paris is famous for landmarks. The Eiffel Tower is a must. The Louvre Museum is another major attraction. The Arc de Triomphe and Notre-Dame come to mind too. I should include those. Also, the city is known for its cuisine, like baguettes and croissants, and its fashion scene, which is quite influential.<br><br>I should think about Paris's history. It's been a political and cultural hub for centuries. It's the birthplace of many famous people, like Charlie de Gaulle and Victor Hugo. The Paris Agreement is another important fact, as it's related to climate change.<br><br>Economically, Paris is a significant center. It's home to major companies and financial institutions. The Île-de-France region is part of theGreater Paris metropolitan area, which is quite large.<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has an extensive public transit system, including the Métro, which is a large subway network. The Château de Invalides is a notable landmark with the statue of the Last Knight of the French Revolution.<br><br>I should also mention the Paris Agreement, which was signed in 2015. It's about reducing greenhouse gas emissions. That's an important environmental fact.<br><br>Now, putting this all together into a JSON structure. I'll start with a \"name\" field as \"Paris, France\". Then, an \"overview\" that summarizes its significance. The \"facts\" array will contain key points like being the capital, location, landmarks, cuisine, history, economy, transportation, and the Paris Agreement.<br><br>I need to make sure each fact is a string, so I'll just list them as strings without any special formatting. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it simple. Let me check if I missed anything. Maybe the population? But since it's a city, it's over a million, but perhaps that's too detailed for a basic JSON. I'll stick to the main points.<br><br>Wait, I should also include the coordinates more accurately. I think the Eiffel Tower is at 48.8584°N 2.2945°E, but I'm not entirely sure. I might need to double-check that. Also, the Arc de Triomphe is near the Eiffel Tower, so that's correct.<br><br>I think that's a solid list. Now, I'll structure it into JSON, making sure each key is in quotes and the values are strings. I'll separate each fact with a comma. Let me make sure there are no trailing commas to keep it valid JSON.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 120000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the information about the capital of France and present it in JSON format. Let me start by recalling what I know about Paris. I know it's the capital, but I should probably double-check that. Yeah, I'm pretty sure Paris is the administrative capital, but sometimes people might confuse it with other cities like Lyon or Marseille. But no, Paris is definitely the official capital.<br><br>Now, moving on to the population. I think Paris is a very large city, one of the biggest in the world. I remember reading somewhere that it's over 3 million people, but I'm not sure of the exact figure. Maybe around 3.5 million? I should look that up to be accurate, but since I'm just brainstorming, I'll go with that estimate.<br><br>Next, the area. Paris is a big city, but it's also a dense urban area. I think the metropolitan area covers a large region, maybe around 12,000 square kilometers? But the city proper is smaller. I'm not exactly sure, but I'll put 10,500 square kilometers for the city area and 12,000 for the metropolitan area.<br><br>Language is another point. Paris is a center for French culture, so the predominant language there is definitely French. I don't think they speak any other language there predominantly, though there might be some English, especially in tourist areas or with expatriates.<br><br>Cuisine is interesting. Paris is known for its high-end, fine dining, especially French cuisine. I know places like Le Faitout and others that are famous for their intricate dishes. Parisians are also known for their coffee culture, so maybe that's another point to include.<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has an extensive public transit system. The RER and地铁 are part of the BTP, which I think stands for Bahn, Tram, and Metro in German, but in French, it's the same. The city is well-connected by train, with major stations like Gare du Nord and Châtelet. The Eiffel Tower is a major landmark, and it's accessible by train from Paris.<br><br>I should also mention some of the main attractions. The Eiffel Tower is iconic, along with the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. These are must-see spots for tourists.<br><br>Now, putting this all together into JSON format. I'll structure it with an \"info\" key that contains a \"capital\" object with \"name,\" \"population,\" \"area,\" and \"language.\" Then, an \"attractions\" array that lists the main points of interest. I'll make sure the numbers are approximate since I don't have exact figures on hand.<br><br>Wait, I should check if the population is over 3 million or 3.5. I think it's around 3.5 million as of recent estimates. The area, I'm pretty sure the metropolitan area is about 12,000 km², and the city proper is a bit less, maybe 10,500 km². That seems right.<br><br>So, the JSON structure would have the info object with the necessary details, and the attractions array listing the main landmarks.

I also remember that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, and it's a symbol of the country. So if Paris is the capital, then that makes sense.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is in New York and wants to know the current date and time as well as the weather. I need to figure out how to provide this information using the functions available. <br><br>First, I remember that there's a function called get_current_date which requires a timezone parameter. The user is in New York, so the timezone should be 'America/New_York'. I'll need to structure that into a JSON object.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I should use get_current_weather. The user didn't specify the city and state, but since they're in New York, I can assume it's 'New York' and 'NY'. They also didn't mention the unit, so I'll default to Fahrenheit since that's a common preference, but I should check if the function requires it. Looking at the function's parameters, it does accept 'unit' with enum ['celsius', 'fahrenheit'], so I'll include 'unit': 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>Now, I need to call both functions in separate messages. The first one for the date and time, and the second one for the weather. I'll format each function call according to the specified structure, ensuring the parameters are correctly included as JSON objects within curly braces.<br><br>I should also remember to include the source links for each function in the response, as per the instructions. So, I'll add a reference to the US weather API for the weather function and the time conversion API for the date and time function.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write two separate function calls: one for the date and time with the timezone, and another for the weather with the city, state, and unit. Each will be on its own line as per the user's example.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function>  <br><br>Source:  <br>- US weather API (get_current_weather): https://openweathermap.org/  <br>- Time conversion API (get_current_date): https://time.is/</strong>"

      "{'text': 'Okay, so I need to provide the information about the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, I\\'m not entirely sure about all the details, but I\\'ll try to think it through.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty much a given, right? But I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall any other capitals I know. London is the capital of the UK, Rome is Italy, and maybe Tokyo is Japan\\'s. Yeah, Paris seems correct for France.\\n\\nNow, moving on to the population. I think Paris is a very large city, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I remember it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not certain. Maybe around 3.5 million? I should probably look that up, but since I can\\'t right now, I\\'ll go with 3,500,000 as an estimate.\\n\\nNext, the area. Paris is a big city, but I think it\\'s not as large as Tokyo or London. Maybe around 10 square kilometers? I\\'m not sure, but that seems plausible. I\\'ll note that as 10,000,000 square meters.\\n\\nCoordinates are next. Paris is in France, so the country code is \"FR\". The latitude and longitude... I think the approximate coordinates are around 48.8566° N latitude and 2.3522° E longitude. I remember that Paris is in the northern and eastern parts of France, so those should be correct.\\n\\nOfficial languages. France is a country with a lot of languages, but I think French is the official language. I\\'m not sure if they have others, but French is definitely the primary one. Maybe they also have some other languages spoken there, but I\\'ll stick with French for now.\\n\\nOfficial currency is the euro, right? Yeah, I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s correct. They use the euro as their main currency.\\n\\nI should also consider if there\\'s anything else I might need to include. Maybe the capital\\'s nickname? I think Paris is called the \"City of Light\" or something like that. But the user didn\\'t ask for that, so maybe it\\'s not necessary.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with the key-value pairs. The keys should be in English, and the values can be numbers, strings, or maybe even objects if needed. Since the population and area are numerical, I\\'ll represent them as numbers. The rest can be strings.\\n\\nWait, but in JSON, numbers don\\'t have commas, right? So 3,500,000 should be written as 3500000 without the comma. Same with the area, 10,000,000 square meters becomes 10000000.\\n\\nLet me make sure I\\'m formatting the JSON correctly. The keys should be in double quotes, and the values can be numbers or strings. So the structure would be something like:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"area\": 10000000,\\n  \"country\": \"FR\",\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n  },\\n  \"languages\": \"French\",\\n  \"currency\": \"Euro\"\\n}\\n\\nWait, but the coordinates are just two numbers, so maybe I don\\'t need a nested object. So it would be:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"area\": 10000000,\\n  \"country\": \"FR\",\\n  \"coordinates\": {\\n    \"latitude\": 48.8566,\\n    \"longitude\": 2.3522\\n  },\\n  \"languages\": \"French\",\\n  \"currency\": \"Euro\"\\n}\\n\\nThat looks better. I think that\\'s all the information I need. I should make sure that the numerical values don\\'t have commas and that the strings are in double quotes. Also, the keys should be in lowercase letters as per JSON standards.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve covered everything. Population and area are estimates, but they\\'re close enough for a general JSON format. I don\\'t think I need to include more details unless specified. So, this should be the correct JSON structure for the information about the capital of France.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000', 'meta_info': {'id': '796b641fa9ad4ad8b762a2e47dd0b1b1', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'length', 'length': 2048}, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 2048, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 19.178267240524292}}\n"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the derivative of a function, right? Let me see. The function is f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5. I remember from class that to find the derivative, I need to use the power rule. \\n\\nAlright, the power rule says that if I have a function like x^n, its derivative is n*x^(n-1). So, applying that to each term of the function should give me the derivative. Let\\'s break it down term by term.\\n\\nFirst term: 3x^2. The exponent is 2, so I bring that down as a coefficient, multiply it by 3, which gives me 6. Then, I reduce the exponent by 1, so it becomes x^(2-1) = x^1, which is just x. So, the derivative of 3x^2 is 6x.\\n\\nSecond term: 2x. The exponent here is 1 because x is the same as x^1. Applying the power rule, I bring down the 1 as a coefficient, multiply it by 2, which gives me 2. Then, reduce the exponent by 1, so it becomes x^(1-1) = x^0, which is 1. So, the derivative of 2x is 2.\\n\\nThird term: -5. This is a constant term. I remember that the derivative of a constant is zero because there\\'s no change as x changes. So, the derivative of -5 is 0.\\n\\nNow, putting it all together, the derivative of f(x) should be 6x + 2. Wait, let me double-check. The first term\\'s derivative is 6x, the second is 2, and the third is 0. So, yes, adding them up gives 6x + 2.\\n\\nI think that\\'s it. But just to be sure, maybe I should plug in a value for x and see if the derivative makes sense. Let\\'s say x = 1. The original function f(1) = 3(1)^2 + 2(1) - 5 = 3 + 2 - 5 = 0. The derivative at x=1 is 6(1) + 2 = 8. So, at the point (1,0), the slope of the tangent line should be 8. That seems reasonable.\\n\\nAnother check: x = 0. f(0) = 3(0)^2 + 2(0) -5 = -5. The derivative at x=0 is 6(0) + 2 = 2. So, the slope at (0,-5) is 2. That also makes sense because the function is a parabola opening upwards, so the slope at the vertex (which is at x = -b/(2a) = -2/(6) = -1/3) should be zero. Wait, but at x=0, it\\'s 2. Hmm, maybe I should calculate the slope at x = -1/3. Let\\'s see, f\\'(-1/3) = 6*(-1/3) + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0. Yes, that\\'s correct. So, the derivative at x=0 is 2, which is positive, meaning the function is increasing there, which aligns with the parabola\\'s shape.\\n\\nI think I\\'m confident now. The derivative is 6x + 2.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"StepbyStepSolution\",\\n\"population\": 1000000000\\n\\n\\n  \\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n \\t\\t}', 'meta_info': {'id': '48b2dcf2fd6e4ab9b30585c29e5fed97', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 5, 'completion_tokens': 790, 'cached_tokens': 2, 'e2e_latency': 7.191127300262451}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user is asking for the information of the capital of France in the JSON format. Hmm, okay, France\\'s capital is Paris, right? But wait, the user likely wants this information structured properly. Maybe they\\'re working on a project or a website where they need a JSON input.\\n\\nFirst, I should start by understanding the components of the JSON they\\'re looking for. Typically, a JSON structure includes a name, population, and some key facts. So, Paris has a population of around 2.2 million. I should double-check that number to make sure it\\'s accurate. Yep, it\\'s definitely over two million people.\\n\\nNext, the facts. Paris is known for being the \"city of light\" with its iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. Squared, it\\'s a major economic hub but is sometimes referred to as the \"Eưde de Katzour\" or something like that? I think the French term is \"aqu educational district.\" I should verify that. Oh right, it\\'s often called le Quartier Latin or the Jardin du Luxembourg, maybe. Wait, no, \"Eưde de Katzour\" is another term for the area around the Seine near the Louvre. Okay, I might have heard that term before.\\n\\nThen, the symbolism of Paris is significant. It\\'s the winner of the 2024 Summer Olympics, so that\\'s an important fact. Also, it\\'s a cradle of French culture, literature, and history. I should include that to provide a comprehensive overview.\\n\\nNow, considering the user\\'s request, they probably want this in JSON for easy data extraction or display. So I should structure the JSON with the key \"paris\" pointing to another object containing the name, population, and facts. That seems clear.\\n\\nI should also think about the user\\'s potential deeper needs. Maybe they\\'re integrating this data into an app or a website, so accuracy is key. They might need it in a format that\\'s easy to parse, which JSON is good for.\\n\\nDouble-checking all the facts: population, landmarks, economic status, and symbolic roles. I think that covers the essentials. Maybe adding placeholders for the population growth in the future if that\\'s needed, but for now, using the current best estimate is fine.\\n\\nPutting it all together, ensuring that the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets in the right places. No trailing commas because that could cause errors in parsing.\\n\\nSo, to summarize, I\\'ll create a JSON object with \"paris\" as the key, containing the necessary details under another object, making sure all the information is accurate and presented clearly.\\n</think>\\n\\nSure! Here is the information of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"paris\": {\\n    \"name\": \"City of Light\",\\n    \"population\": 2145000,\\n    \"facts\": [\\n      \"Paris is the capital city of France and is known as the \\'City of Light\\' due to its iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum.\",\\n      \"It is located on the Seine River and is a major economic and cultural hub in Europe.\",\\n      \"Paris is also the administrative center of France and is home to many international organizations and businesses.\"\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet me know if you need any other information!', 'meta_info': {'id': '357c2b857a054758b0e678a7880154b2', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 692, 'cached_tokens': 19, 'e2e_latency': 6.404293537139893}}</strong>"

      "\n",
      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to provide the information about the capital of France in JSON format. Let me think about how to approach this.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty straightforward, but I guess I should confirm it to be sure. I remember that Paris is not only the capital but also a major city in France itself. I think I heard somewhere that it's one of the most visited cities in the world, so it must be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, what else do I need to include in the JSON? Well, the basic information would be the city name, country, and status. So that's easy. I can write:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": {\n",
      "    \"city\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "    \"country\": \"France\",\n",
      "    \"status\": \"Official\"\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe I should add a bit more detail. I recall that Paris is the largest city in France and also the second-largest in the world after Moscow. It's located in the northern part of the country. I think it's situated in the Val-d'Oise department. The climate is temperate, so it has both summer and winter. The main landmarks include the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and the Notre-Dame Cathedral. There's also the Sorbonne University and the Paris Opera.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the department. Let me think. Paris is actually divided into twenty-six arrondissements, not a department. The department is Val-d'Oise, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should check that. Also, Paris has been the capital since the early 19th century, right? Before that, were there other capitals?\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe before 18th century, Paris wasn't the capital. Let me recall the history. Before the revolution, the capital was located in three different places: first, in Beauvais; then in Orléans; and finally in Paris after 1792. So the official status as the capital was established after the revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "So maybe I should include some of that historical context. But the user only asked for the basic information, so perhaps I don't need to go into that much detail unless they ask for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, Paris is known for its cuisine, like baguettes, baguette sandwiches, and various pastries. It's a cultural hub with many museums and historical sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should structure this information into a JSON format, making sure it's clean and easy to read. Let me organize the key details: city name, country, status as capital, main landmarks, climate, and maybe some fun facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I can create a more detailed JSON like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": {\n",
      "    \"city\": \"Paris\",\n",

      "    \"landmarks\": [\n",
      "      \"Eiffel Tower\",\n",
      "      \"Louvre Museum\",\n",
      "      \"Notre-Dame Cathedral\",\n",
      "      \"Sorbonne University\",\n",
      "      \"Paris Opera\"\n",

      "    }\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm not sure if Paris is the largest city in France or in the world. I think it's the largest in France, but I'm not certain about the world ranking. Maybe I should check that. Also, Paris is known as the \"City of Light,\" with the Eiffel Tower and other landmarks. But I should be accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point is that Paris is the administrative center, but sometimes the economic center. After the fall of the French Ancien Régime, Paris became the capital and remained so until now.\n",

      "So, in summary, the JSON should include the city name, country, status, landmarks, climate, some historical context, and fun facts. I think that covers the main aspects. Now, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure it's correctly formatted with commas and brackets.\n",
