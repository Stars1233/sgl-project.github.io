    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

They're expecting me to respond with the necessary information. <br><br>First, I need to figure out which functions to use. There are two functions available: get_current_weather and get_current_date. The user mentioned both the date and the weather, so I'll need to call both functions.<br><br>Starting with the date, I should use get_current_date. The required parameter is the timezone, which in this case is 'America/New_York'. I'll structure the function call with the timezone argument.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I'll use get_current_weather. The parameters needed here are the city, state, and unit. The city is 'New York', the state is 'NY', and the unit should be 'fahrenheit' since the user might be more familiar with that.<br><br>I need to make sure I format each function call correctly. Each should start with <function= followed by the function name and then the parameters in JSON format. The parameters should be a JSON object with the argument names as keys and the corresponding values.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll send two separate function calls: one for the date and another for the weather. Each will be a single line, properly formatted with the start and end tags as specified.<br><br>I should also remember to include sources where I used the information, but since these are predefined functions, I don't need to add any external sources beyond the function calls themselves.<br><br>So, the final response will have both function calls, each on their own line, ensuring clarity and correctness.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '10141eed40bf4e92b779088512fb212f', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.569876670837402}}</strong>"

First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. Now, the user wants this information in JSON, so I need to structure it properly.\\n\\nHmm, I should probably include basic details like the name of the city, its location, the capital status, and the latest population data. Wait, do I have the exact population number? I think in recent years, Paris has had a population around 2 million, but I should confirm. Maybe 2,158,700? I recall that from recent sources.\\n\\nI also think about whether to include the metropolitan area population since that can sometimes be different. Paris’s metropolitan area is a bit larger, around 10.5 million people. Including that could provide a more comprehensive answer.\\n\\nI need to make sure the JSON structure is clear and easy to read. So, I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"Name,\" \"Location,\" \"Capital,\" and \"Population.\" Under Population, I\\'ll have another object that includes both the city proper and the metropolitan area with their respective numbers and units.\\n\\nWait, should I include the unit abbreviation? Like \"Population: 2.16 million\" instead of just the number with commas. That might make it clearer. Let me adjust for that.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I should make sure the JSON is valid. I\\'ll use proper braces and commas. No trailing commas to follow JSON standards. \\n\\nLet me double-check the population number to ensure accuracy. A quick search in my memory tells me that as of the latest data, Paris has a population of approximately 2,158,700 in the city, and the metropolitan area is around 10,562,000. So, that should be correct.\\n\\nAlright, I think the JSON structure is solid. I\\'ll present it to the user, and they can use it as needed. This should meet their request effectively, providing the necessary information in an organized format.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"Name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Location\": \"The capital of France\",\\n  \"Capital\": true,\\n  \"Population\": {\\n    \"Population\": 2158700,\\n    \"Unit\": \"people\"\\n  },\\n  \"oppersMetropolitanArea\": {\\n    \"Population\": 10562000,\\n    \"Unit\": \"people\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '1dc092caf5db48d0a6ece7584cb097f2', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 540, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 9.029813051223755}}</strong>"
