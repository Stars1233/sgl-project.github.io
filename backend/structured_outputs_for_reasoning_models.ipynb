    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

They mentioned two: get_current_weather and get_current_date.<br><br>I'll start with get_current_date because they specifically asked for the date and time. The function requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, the timezone is US/Eastern. I can structure the function call as <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"US/Eastern\"}</function>.<br><br>But they also asked for the weather. So I need to call get_current_weather next. For this, I need the city and state. New York is NY, so the city is \"New York\" and the state is \"NY\". The unit isn't specified, so I'll default to Fahrenheit. The function call will be <function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function>.<br><br>I should make sure each function call is on a separate line and include the sources where I got the information.

I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see... Yes, according to the latest data, the population is approximately 2,174,300 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \"country\". The city is Paris, the population is the number I found, and the country is France.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. The entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. I\\'ll format it properly to avoid any syntax errors.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have the city, population, and country. I\\'ll present this to the user, making sure it\\'s clear and easy to understand. I don\\'t think the user needs anything more detailed, so this should suffice.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need additional information, like the area or age distribution, but since they only asked for population, I\\'ll stick to that. Maybe they\\'ll ask for more details later, but for now, this response should be helpful.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'e1577929a4274d88b828433024cc0673', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 384, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.5131163597106934}}</strong>"

Hmm, first thing first, I need to figure out what exactly they\\'re looking for. The capital of France is definitely Paris, right? So, I should start by confirming that. \\n\\nNow, they want the population. I remember that population numbers can change, so I have to make sure to get the most current data. From what I know, Paris is the largest city in France and one of the most populous in the world. I think the population is around 2 million, but I\\'m not entirely sure if that\\'s accurate. I should double-check that number to be sure. \\n\\nNext, the format. They asked for JSON, so I need to structure the data accordingly. I guess I can create an object with keys like \"city,\" \"country,\" and \"population.\" It\\'s important to ensure that the numbers are up to date. I recall that as of recent estimates, the population is approximately 2,155,000. I should probably include the year it was last measured to avoid confusion.\\n\\nI also need to decide on the unit for the population—probably people, since it\\'s a count. So, I\\'ll format the JSON with correct syntax: key names in quotes, commas between values, and proper use of braces. \\n\\nI should make sure there are no typos and that the information is clear. The user might be using this data for a project or a presentation, so accuracy is crucial. Maybe they also want a reliable source for that data. But since the user didn\\'t specify, I\\'ll stick with the best estimate I have. \\n\\nPutting it all together, I can structure the JSON as a simple object with the city, country, and population fields. Let me make sure that the numbers align and that the commas are in the right places. If I messed up any syntax, it could break their application or document. So, I\\'ll take a moment to proofread it.\\n\\nOverall, this doesn\\'t seem too complicated, but attention to detail is key here. The user probably values clear and accurate information, so I\\'ll present it neatly in JSON without any extra fluff.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"population\": 2155000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON includes the city name, country name, and the approximate population of Paris, France.

      "Next, I should gather the most current and accurate data. The population figure can be a bit tricky because it changes every year. I'll have to make sure to use the latest data available, probably from the 2021 census since that's the most recent I can confirm as of my last update.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should structure the JSON properly. It should include a key like \"capital\" which holds an object containing the city name, its coordinates, and the population. I'll make sure the JSON syntax is correct to avoid any errors.\n",

      "Also, I should keep the response concise and straightforward. The user just wants the information, so I don't need to add any extra details unless they ask for more. I'll double-check the population number to ensure accuracy and present it in a clear format.\n",
