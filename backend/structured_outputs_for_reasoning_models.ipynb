    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

They mentioned being in New York and asking for the current date and time along with the weather. <br><br>First, I know the user wants me to use specific functions provided. For the date and time, there's 'get_current_date', which requires a timezone parameter. Since they're in New York, I'll need to format the timezone string correctly, probably 'America/New_York'.<br><br>Next, for the weather, there's 'get_current_weather'. This function needs a city and state. New York's state abbreviation is NY, so the city is 'New York' and the state is 'NY'. The unit isn't specified, so I'll default to Celsius for temperature.<br><br>I should structure each function call separately, as per the instructions. Each function call needs to be in the specified format, with the function name, parameters in a JSON object, and the entire call on one line.<br><br>So, I'll write two separate function calls. The first for the date and time with the correct timezone, and the second for the weather with the right city and state, using Celsius.<br><br>I also need to make sure each function call is properly formatted with the start and end tags, and that all required parameters are included.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'c26ba43adecd4e3b8867c63e9a0dbecd', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.7356462478637695}}</strong>"

They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Okay, let\\'s break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I should figure out what the capital of France is. I know France\\'s capital is Paris, so that\\'s the city. Next, the information they might need includes the city\\'s name, country, the fact that it\\'s the capital, and the population.\\n\\nBut wait, what is the exact population figure? That might change over time. I think in recent years, Paris has had a population around 3.5 million people, but I\\'m not 100% sure. Maybe it\\'s a good idea to double-check that to make the information accurate.\\n\\nNow, regarding the format, the user specifically asked for JSON. So I\\'ll need to structure the data as a JSON object. The keys should clearly define what each piece of information is. Possible keys could be \"city\", \"country\", \"is_capital\", and \"population\". That makes sense because it organizes the data in a readable and structured way.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that the keys are in English and that the population number is presented correctly. Since it might not be exact, I can include a note about the population figure being approximate. That way, the user is aware that the number could change.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure would look something like this:\\n\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"is_capital\": true,\\n  \"population\": \"Approximately 3,500,000\"\\n}\\n\\nI should probably format it neatly with proper indentation and syntax to ensure it\\'s valid JSON. Also, adding comments or an explanation in the text might help, especially since sometimes users might not be familiar with JSON or might need a refresher on how to use it.\\n\\nWait, should I include units like commas after thousands? In JSON strings, we usually use quotes around the numbers but for readability, adding commas and spaces is okay within the strings. So the population would be written as \"3,500,000\" to make it easier to read.\\n\\nLet me make sure I\\'m not missing anything else. The user asked for the capital\\'s information and population, so including all these details in the JSON should cover what they need. If they need more details, like area, perhaps, but they didn\\'t specify. So sticking to the basics here.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present this JSON in the response, making sure to highlight that the population is approximate because exact numbers can vary based on the source and the year it\\'s measured. That way, the user understands the information provided is a general estimate.\\n\\nI think that covers everything the user asked for. Time to format all of this into a clear and concise JSON response.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"is_capital\": true,\\n  \"population\": \"Approximately 3,500,000\"\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'e12db85970a84cf3bb572868db32ea31', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 654, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 10.200542211532593}}</strong>"
