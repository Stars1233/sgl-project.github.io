    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

Hmm, first I need to figure out which country\\'s capital they\\'re referring to. Capital of France is definitely Paris. But wait, I should make sure because sometimes people might confuse it with another country. \\n\\nAlright, so I should structure the JSON with relevant details. The key points would be the country name, the capital city, its population, and maybe some notable landmarks. I remember Paris has a population around 2 million, but I should double-check that to be accurate. \\n\\nAlso, including interesting facts could add value. For example, the Eiffel Tower is a must. Maybe mention the Paris River and the Louvre Museum as they\\'re iconic. Oh, and how Paris is known as the \"City of Light\" because of its numerous lights, like streetlamps. \\n\\nI should present this information clearly. Maybe separate the key facts into different sections within the JSON so it\\'s easy to read. That way, the user can find the population and other details without cluttering the structure. \\n\\nLet me double-check the population figure. I think it\\'s roughly 2.1 million as of the latest data. As for the landmarks, Eiffel Tower is iconic, so that\\'s a good point to include. Paris is also known for its rich history, so a couple of interesting facts like the old quarters or the Tuileries gardens could be worth mentioning.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have a clear structure with country, capital, population, and interesting facts. I should make sure the grammar and formatting are correct to avoid any errors. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s informative yet concise. The user probably wants the essential information without any fluff. So, avoiding unnecessary details unless they contribute to the main query.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll format it properly, using the JSON structure with arrays and objects as needed. Making sure the keys are descriptive and the values are accurate. That way, the user gets a well-organized and correct response.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2147400,\\n    \"landmarks\": [\\n      \"Eiffel Tower\",\\n      \"Paris River\",\\n      \"Louvre Museum\"\\n    ],\\n    \"notable_facts\": [\\n      \"Known as the \\'City of Light\\' due to its numerous street lamps.\",\\n      \"Home to iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum.\"\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'd0317e7d7f694184bc7ccf71782e3e6f', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 555, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.153828382492065}}</strong>"

I'm pretty sure the population is around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Let me think... yes, I remember that Paris has a population of approximately 2,172,043 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\n",

Let me break it down: the key \"capital\" can be the name of the city, \"population\" can be the number, and maybe a \"year\" to specify when the population was recorded. That way, the data is clear and precise.\n",

      "Putting it all together, the JSON would look like this: an object with \"capital\" as \"Paris\", \"population\" as 2172043, and \"year\" as 2023. I think that covers everything the user asked for. \n",
