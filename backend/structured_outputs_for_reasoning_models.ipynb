    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. \\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I\\'ll stick to that. \\n\\nLastly, I\\'ll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '19f1f2fad62a447381834f13f7025d70', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 412, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 4.087447166442871}}\n"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. <br><br>Next, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I need to figure out the capital of France and its population. I know that the capital is Paris because I\\'ve heard it mentioned a lot, maybe even when talking about movie sets or famous landmarks. But I\\'m not 100% sure, so I should double-check that. Paris is definitely the main city in France where many official events take place, like government meetings and national events. I remember learning in school that Paris is both a city and the capital, so that makes sense. \\n\\nNow, about the population. I think France has around 40 million people, but I\\'m not certain about the exact number. I believe Paris is the most populous city in France, but how many people live there compared to the whole country? I think it might be a significant portion, like over 10 million. But I need to be accurate here. I recall that population figures can change over time due to birth rates, deaths, and migration. Recent years might have different data, so I should consider the latest statistics. Maybe I can think of recent news or official reports. For example, I heard something about Paris having a population over 21 million, but I\\'m not sure if that\\'s the most recent figure. \\n\\nWait, I also remember that the country\\'s population is a bit tricky because it\\'s around 40-41 million out of roughly 330 million people in the EU. So, about 12% of the EU\\'s population. Paris being a major hub would obviously have a larger population than other major cities in France, like Lyon or Marseille, but I\\'m not sure about exact numbers. Maybe I can estimate based on the fact that Paris is the largest city and maybe around 2 million or more. But I think my initial thought of over 21 million is correct, considering what I\\'ve heard before. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the capital is Paris, and its population is over 21 million. I should structure this as a JSON object with the country as \"France,\" the capital as \"Paris,\" and the population as \"over 21 million.\" That seems right, but I should make sure there\\'s no comma in the string since the sample response used \" over\" without any formatting issues. Wait, looking back, the sample response had a space before the comma: \" over 21 million.\" I should replicate that to avoid any errors. \\n\\nI think I\\'m good. Capital is Paris, population over 21 million, formatted correctly in JSON. No other aspects are needed since the user only requested this information in that specific format.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is Paris with a population of over 21 million.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": \"over 21 million\"\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'f12a299a07574b939d574014f082a458', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 585, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.539721727371216}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, I need to find the information and population of the capital of France, which is Paris. Let me start by recalling what I know about Paris. It's a major city in France, known for its rich history, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum, and it's the political, economic, and cultural center of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "For population, I'm not exactly sure of the current number, but I know it's a large city. I think it's over 3 million people. Maybe around 3.5 million? I should check that. I remember that major cities in countries with roughly 40 million people usually have capitals in the tens of millions. Paris is one of the largest capitals in Europe, so that makes sense.\n",

      "I should structure the JSON response with the population first, followed by the key facts. I need to make sure the population is accurate, so I'll look up the latest estimates. As of recent data, Paris' population is approximately 3,500,000 people. That seems right based on what I know.\n",

      "Putting it all together, the JSON should have a key for \"capital\" with the name \"Paris\" and a key for \"population\" with the number 3,500,000. Then, another key \"key_facts\" containing the list of important points I mentioned earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should double-check the population number to ensure it's up to date. Maybe I can recall that it's been growing, so 3.5 million is a reasonable estimate for now. I don't think I need to change it unless I find specific data, which I don't at the moment.\n",
