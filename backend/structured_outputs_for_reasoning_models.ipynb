    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '5de4bb5590d441899d1bda55b4ed458e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.588111400604248}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user\\'s query about the population of the capital of France. Let me start by recalling what the user asked for. They wanted information and the population of the capital city in JSON format. \\n\\nFirst, I should identify the capital of France, which I know is Paris. That\\'s pretty straightforward. Now, I need to find the current population of Paris. I remember that population numbers can change based on various factors like births, deaths, and migrations. I think in recent years, Paris has been growing steadily, but it\\'s not exactly a fast-growing city compared to some others in Europe.\\n\\nI should make sure to note that the population figure might be approximate since, for accurate, real-time data, one would typically consult the latest census or official statistics from organizations like the National Institute of Statistics and Administrative register (INSEE) or the European Commission\\'s Eurostat. Using an approximate figure could help the user, but I should also include a note about that to ensure they understand the data\\'s source and potential variations over time.\\n\\nAdditionally, the population can vary depending on when it\\'s measured. For instance, the population estimate from 2021 is around 3.5 million, but it\\'s something the user should check if they need a more precise figure. \\n\\nSo, putting this together, I can structure the JSON response with the key \"capital\" set to \"Paris\" and \"population\" as the approximate number. Also, adding a comment about the population figure approximation would be helpful. That way, the user knows it\\'s an estimate and to consult official sources for the most accurate data.\\n\\nI should double-check if there\\'s a standard way to format such information. Using a JSON structure is appropriate since it\\'s a common data format. The keys should clearly present the necessary information: name of the city and its population.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider is whether the population figure includes only the city proper or if it includes汢单词 contextual areas. Paris is a large city, and sometimes data might refer to a metropolitan area. But since the user just asked for the capital, I think the city proper count is sufficient unless specified otherwise.\\n\\nIn summary, I\\'ll create a JSON object with the key \"capital\" as Paris and \"population\" as approximately 3.5 million, adding a note indicating that the figure is an approximation based on recent data.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3523000,\\n  \"comment\": \"This population figure is approximate and based on recent estimates.\"\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'd103f8b94f1149aa9828f6ee671a7ddf', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 532, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.113919019699097}}</strong>"
