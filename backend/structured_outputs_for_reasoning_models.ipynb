    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '0ede15b348bb4eb0a012648147c40309', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.700430631637573}}</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I remember it\\'s Paris, but just to be sure, I\\'ll double-check that fact. Yeah, Paris is definitely the capital.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population data for Paris. I know that population figures can change over time, so I\\'ll have to include both an approximate current estimate and maybe a recent figure, like from 2022. From what I recall, Paris has a population around 2 million people. But I should make sure this is up-to-date. I can look it up, but since I can\\'t browse the internet, I\\'ll go with the most recent information I have available or provide a common figure.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight data-interchange format that\\'s easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. So, I\\'ll structure it with a key-value pair where the key is \"capitalInformation\" and the value is an object containing the population details.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks. Sometimes extra spaces can mess things up, so I\\'ll keep it clean. Also, I\\'ll include the country name as \"France\" to associate the population with the correct country.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look like this: a main object with a key \"capitalInformation\" that points to another object with \"capital\" and \"population\" fields. The population field will have an object with \"currentPopulation\" and \"year\" for the most recent data, and maybe an \"approximatePopulation\" for a general estimate.\\n\\nLet me make sure the numbers are accurate. The current population is around 2,173,000, and the approximate figure is 2.2 million, which sounds right. I\\'ll also note the years these numbers are valid for, so the user knows the data\\'s currentness.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present this in a clear, concise manner without any extra fluff. The user just wants the information and population in JSON, so keeping it straightforward is best.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capitalInformation\": {\\n    \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": {\\n      \"currentPopulation\": 2173000,\\n      \"year\": 2022,\\n      \"approximatePopulation\": 2200000\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'a903488be96548ef8ce12fcb68b8076a', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 559, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.154594421386719}}</strong>"

      "Prompt: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜>Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜><think>\n",
      "\n",
      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to find out the population of the capital of France and present it in JSON format. First, I should figure out what the capital of France is. From what I remember, Paris is the capital of France, right? Yeah, that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to find out the current population of Paris. I'm not exactly sure about the exact number, but I think it's around 2 million people. I've heard that Paris is a very populous city, but I'm not certain about the exact figure. Maybe it's a bit more than that? I think it's been growing over the years, especially with its status as a major tourist destination and economic hub.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try to recall any recent statistics. I believe in the mid-2010s, Paris had a population of about 2.1 million. But I'm not entirely sure if it's exactly 2 million or more. Maybe I should verify this. If I recall correctly, the population figure is often cited as approximately 2.17 million in recent years. That seems more precise.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting this together, the capital of France is Paris, and its population is about 2.17 million people. Now, I need to format this information into a JSON structure. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll need to decide which keys to use. Since the question is specifically about the population, I should include the country name and the population number.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the JSON format should have a key for the country, like \"country\", and another for the population, maybe \"population\". So, it would look something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"country\": \"France\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 2170000\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I wrote 2170000, which is 2,170,000. But I'm not 100% confident if that's the exact number. Maybe it's better to use a more precise figure. Let me think again. I think the exact population might be around 2,170,000, so 2170000 in numeric form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a standard way to represent population numbers in JSON? I believe using numbers directly is acceptable, but sometimes they might prefer formatted numbers with commas for readability. However, in JSON, numbers don't have commas; those are for display purposes in human-readable formats. So, 2170000 is correct in JSON.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the data type. Since it's a population count, it's an integer, so using a number type without decimal points is fine. I don't need to use a string unless I'm including textual data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything else I need to include? The original question was just about the capital and its population, so I think that's all that's needed. I should make sure the keys are clear and descriptive so that anyone reading the JSON can understand what the numbers represent.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to summarize, the JSON object should have a key \"country\" with the value \"France\" and a key \"population\" with the value 2170000. That should accurately represent the information requested.\n",
