    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

The user didn't specify a city, but since they're in New York, I can assume they want the weather for that location. So I'll use the get_current_weather function with 'New York' as the city.

Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

I remember that the capital of France is Paris, so that\\'s my starting point. Now, I need to recall or look up the population of Paris.\\n\\nI think Paris has a pretty large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure about the exact figure. I know it\\'s in the hundreds of millions, but I\\'m not certain. Let me try breaking it down. I think the metro area of Paris is super big. I\\'ve heard it\\'s over 12 million people. But that might include just the city, not the entire metro.\\n\\nWait, the population of the city of Paris might be around 2 million to 3 million. And then the metro area, which includes surrounding suburbs, is definitely larger. I think I\\'ve seen numbers around 12 to 17 million for the metro. So, I should probably list both, just in case.\\n\\nAlso, maybe there\\'s some data about Paris as a whole versus the metro. I remember somewhere mentioning that the city proper has a population between 2 and 3 million, and the metro area is much bigger. So, I\\'ll include both figures to make sure the information is clear.\\n\\nI should structure the JSON appropriately. Maybe two objects: one for the city and one for the metro. Each object can have a label and the population number. I\\'ll use Unicode for the population symbols to keep it clean. So, for example, mixing \\'ディング\\' for a population of 2 million and \\'גב Dancing Symbol\\' for the metro.\\n\\nWait, I don\\'t want to use crazy Unicode symbols because it might not display correctly in some systems. Maybe I should use standard symbols or just write out the numbers with the Unicode population signs. Let me think. The population of the city is about 2.2 million, so I can use \\' IsActive \\' for the city and \\'Is括号 \\' for the metro. That way, it\\'s clear and readable.\\n\\nAlright, putting it all together, I\\'ll create a JSON object with an \"info\" key and inside that, two \"capital_info\" objects, one for the city and one for the metro, each containing \"capital\" and \"population\" keys. The populations will use the Unicode population symbols so it\\'s noticeable and easy to read.\\n\\nI think that\\'s a solid structure. It clearly presents the population in both the city and metro areas, making it comprehensive. Now, I\\'ll write the JSON out with these details. I should double-check the population numbers to ensure accuracy, but I\\'m pretty confident they\\'re in the right ballpark. If I wasn\\'t sure, I could always look up the most recent data, but for now, I\\'ll proceed with what I have.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"info\": {\\n    \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"capital_info\": {\\n      \"capital_info_city\": {\\n        \"capital\": \"City of Paris\",\\n        \"population\": \"IsActive\"  // Represents 2.2 million\\n      },\\n      \"capital_info_metro\": {\\n        \"capital\": \"Metropolitan Paris\",\\n        \"population\": \"Isbr括号\"  // Represents 13 million\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '806d59347b324cd69419776d09e62a11', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 669, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.2864601612091064}}</strong>"

However, population numbers can fluctuate, so I should mention that the figure might vary slightly depending on the source and the year. \n",

Also, keeping it simple and clear for the user is important. \n",
