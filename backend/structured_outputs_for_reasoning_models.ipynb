    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

Let me break down how I can help them using the available functions.<br><br>First, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user mentioned they want two pieces of information: the current date and time, and the weather. I have two functions available: 'get_current_date' and 'get_current_weather'. <br><br>Starting with the date and time, I should use 'get_current_date'. The function requires a 'timezone' parameter. Since the user is in New York, I'll set 'America/New_York' as the timezone. I need to structure this as a JSON object within the function call format they specified. So it would be <function=date>{{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}}</function>.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I'll use 'get_current_weather'. This function needs a 'city' and 'state' parameter. The city is New York, and the state is NY. I should format this as a JSON object too, making sure to include both required parameters. That would look like <function=weather>{{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\"}}</function>.<br><br>Now, I should combine these two function calls into a single message. I'll list them one after the other for clarity. I also need to add the sources where I got the information from, but since these are direct function calls, I can mention that the data is from the functions provided.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll make sure each function call is on its own line, using the correct syntax with curly braces and square brackets. I'll also include a note about the sources to show transparency in my process.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{  <br>  \"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"  <br>}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{  <br>  \"city\": \"New York\",  <br>  \"state\": \"NY\"  <br>  , \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"  <br>}</function>  <br>Sources: get_current_date and get_current_weather functions</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. \\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I\\'ll stick to that. \\n\\nLastly, I\\'ll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '8331e46b8e4545a1ae02e2c656e46a3f', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 412, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 3.7766177654266357}}\n"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. <br><br>Next, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with commas and quotation marks. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll put each key on a new line. That way, the user can quickly see the information without confusion. <br><br>I wonder if the user needs more details, like the exact current population or additional statistics. But since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to that. <br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is valid by checking the syntax. No trailing commas, proper use of braces, and correct quotation marks. That should cover everything the user needs.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 3500000<br>}</strong>"

I should include the current population. I remember that Paris has grown a bit over the years, but exact numbers can be tricky. I think the population is around 2,100,000, but I should note that it might vary depending on the source and the year. \\n\\nI should make sure the JSON is correctly formatted. Maybe I\\'ll structure it with an \"info\" key containing details and a \"population\" key with the number. Including the unit (thousand people) makes it clear. I\\'ll also add a note about the population figure to inform the user that it\\'s approximate. That way, they know there might be slight differences. \\n\\nI wonder if they need more detailed data, like the latest census or a range, but since they didn\\'t specify, a standard figure should suffice. Keeping it simple and clear is best for their needs. I\\'ll double-check the population to ensure it\\'s up-to-date and accurate. \\n\\nAlright, putting it all together in JSON. Make sure there are commas in the right places and brackets properly closed. I don\\'t need to add extra messages unless they ask for more information, so I\\'ll stick to the JSON response.

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let's start by identifying the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, but just to be sure, I'll think about it. Yes, Paris is indeed the capital city of France. It's a major city in the country, serving as the administrative center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a very large city with a significant population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current numbers. I think it's over 3 million people, but I might be off a bit. Maybe I should consider recent estimates or data from official sources to get an accurate figure. Let me try to recall if I've heard any specific numbers before. I believe the population is around 3,500,000, but I'm not entirely certain. Perhaps it's slightly higher now, considering the city's growth over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the structure of the JSON format. It typically includes keys with relevant information. In this case, the main keys would be \"city\" for the name and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets in the right places to avoid any errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm a bit unsure about the exact population number. I think it might have increased a bit in recent years. Maybe around 3,500,000 as of 2023? I should double-check that to be accurate, but since I don't have access to external resources right now, I'll go with that estimate for the purpose of this exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should have an object with two keys: \"city\" and \"population\". The value for \"city\" is \"Paris\", and the value for \"population\" is the number I came up with, which is 3,500,000. I'll format it correctly with braces and commas.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure that the JSON is valid. That means each key should be in double quotes, and the values should be correctly assigned. The structure should be like this: {\"city\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 3500000}. That looks right.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, I identified the capital as Paris, estimated its population to be around 3.5 million, and structured the JSON accordingly. I'm a bit uncertain about the exact population number, but for the purpose of this task, it's acceptable.\n",
