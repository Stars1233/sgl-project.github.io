    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I remember it's over 3 million, but I'm not certain if it's 3.5 or 3.6. I should double-check that.<br><br>Next, I thought about the structure. The user wants JSON, so I need to format it correctly with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\". I should make sure the syntax is correct—no typos, proper commas, and brackets. <br><br>I also considered the user's possible needs. They might be doing a project or a presentation, so providing accurate data is crucial. Maybe they're a student learning about France's capitals or someone compiling demographic data. Either way, precision is key.<br><br>I decided to present the information clearly, ensuring the JSON is valid and easy to read. I included the population as 3.617 million, which I believe is the most recent figure I could recall.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the current date and time along with the weather in New York. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I need the current date and time. The user mentioned it's in New York, so I should use the 'get_current_date' function. The function requires a timezone parameter. I recall that New York is in the Eastern Time Zone, often abbreviated as EST, but the full IANA timezone name is 'America/New_York'. I think using the full name is safer to avoid any issues.<br><br>Next, I need the current weather. For that, I should use the 'get_current_weather' function. The function requires a city, state, and unit. I know the city is New York, but I need the state abbreviation. New York's state is NY. The unit is probably Fahrenheit since that's the standard in the US, but the function allows both, so I'll specify 'fahrenheit' to be precise.<br><br>Now, I need to structure the function calls correctly. I should first call 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter set to 'America/New_York'. Then, I'll call 'get_current_weather' with the city as 'New York', state as 'NY', and unit as 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>I should make sure to format each function call correctly, using the specified JSON structure. Also, I must remember to include the source links for each function in the response to provide credibility.<br><br>Wait, before I proceed, I should double-check the function parameters to ensure I'm not missing anything. For 'get_current_date', the timezone is the only required parameter. For 'get_current_weather', city, state, and unit are all required. All good.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll first send the date function, then the weather function. That should cover everything the user asked for.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function>  <br><br>Sources:  <br>- [get_current_date](https://docs.example.com)  <br>- [get_current_weather](https://docs.example.com)</strong>"

      "Generated text: Alright, so I need to figure out the capital of France and then provide its population in JSON format. Okay, let me start by recalling what I know about France. I know that Paris is the capital of France, but I'm not exactly sure about its current population. It must be a large city, but I don't remember the exact number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think the population is in the millions. Maybe around 2 million? Or is it more? I remember that major European cities can have populations over 3 million. Let me try to think if I've heard any recent numbers. I think it's been increasing because of population growth over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also recall that France's population is around 40 million, but that's the entire country, not just Paris. So Paris, being the capital, should have a smaller population than that. I think it's somewhere between 2 and 3 million. Maybe closer to 3 million? I'm not entirely certain, so perhaps I should look it up to confirm.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since I'm supposed to provide this information in JSON format, I guess I'll have to make an educated guess. Let me double-check my memory. I believe Paris has a population of approximately 2.1 million. That seems right because I've heard it mentioned in various contexts, like tourism or news about city growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so putting it all together, the capital of France is Paris, and its population is around 2.1 million. Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so the keys would be \"country\" and \"capital\", and the values would be the respective data.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the JSON structure would look something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"country\": \"France\",\n",
      "  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 2100000\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, is 2100000 the correct numerical representation? Yes, 2.1 million is 2,100,000. I think that's accurate. I don't see any other information needed, just the population of the capital. I don't need to include the country's population or anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure that the JSON is properly formatted with the correct syntax, using commas and quotes appropriately. Let me visualize it again:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"country\": \"France\",\n",
      "  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 2100000\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that looks right. I think I'm done here. I provided the necessary information in the required JSON format without any extra details. Hopefully, this meets the user's request.\n",
