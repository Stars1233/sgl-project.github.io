    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, I should also think about the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I'll present it as a JSON object. I'll make sure there are no typos and that the data is correctly formatted. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.<br><br>Another thing to consider is whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm not accessing real-time data, I'll go with the most recent estimate I have. I recall that Paris has grown a bit in recent years, so 2 million seems reasonable, but I should confirm if it's 2.1 million or something else.<br><br>I also wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or the establishment year of the city, but the query specifically mentions population, so I'll stick to that. Still, it's good to know that I can provide additional information if needed.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy for the user to understand and use. I'll review the JSON structure to ensure there are no syntax errors before sending it back to the user.<br><br><br>content: {\"name\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2145000}</strong>"

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, their capitals are Mexico City and Madrid, respectively.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each capital. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million, but it's growing, so maybe I should note that the figure is approximate.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same fields. Also, I'll add a comment at the top to explain the data, making it clear for anyone reading the JSON.<br><br>I need to be careful with the syntax to avoid errors. JSON requires proper quotation marks and commas. Each object in the array should be separated by a comma, and the entire structure should be valid. Maybe I'll write it out step by step to ensure accuracy.<br><br>Additionally, I should consider if the user needs more details, like the country's area or other statistics, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that. However, offering to include more data in the future might be a good idea, showing flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, I'll make sure the JSON is well-formatted and easy to read, perhaps by indenting it for better readability. That way, the user can easily parse the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

I remember that I have two functions available for this: get_current_date and get_current_weather. I need to figure out which one to use and how to structure the call.<br><br>First, the user wants the date and time for a specific timezone, which is New York. So I should use get_current_date. The parameters required are the timezone. I'll need to set timezone to 'America/New_York'.<br><br>Next, they also want the current weather. That means I should call get_current_weather. The parameters needed are city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state would be NY, and the unit should be in Fahrenheit since that's a common preference, but the user didn't specify, so maybe I should include both or default to Fahrenheit. Wait, the function description says it's optional, but to be helpful, I might include both units to cover possible preferences.<br><br>Wait, but the initial response only used one function. Maybe I should handle each request separately. So I'll first call get_current_date with the timezone and then get_current_weather with the necessary parameters.<br><br>I should structure the response as two separate function calls to be clear. Also, I need to add the sources from OpenWeatherMap and TimeAndDate for credibility.<br><br>So putting it all together, I'll send two function calls: one for the date and time, and another for the weather with both temperature units included for flexibility.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see... Yes, according to the latest data, the population is approximately 2,174,300 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \"country\". The city is Paris, the population is the number I found, and the country is France.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. The entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. I\\'ll format it properly to avoid any syntax errors.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have the city, population, and country. I\\'ll present this to the user, making sure it\\'s clear and easy to understand. I don\\'t think the user needs anything more detailed, so this should suffice.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need additional information, like the area or age distribution, but since they only asked for population, I\\'ll stick to that. Maybe they\\'ll ask for more details later, but for now, this response should be helpful.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '3ee823ed91ba49a1af9506af8f57f55e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 384, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.458264112472534}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to find out the population of the capital of France. The capital is Paris, right? I think that\\'s correct because I remember hearing that Paris is the main city there and people often say \"capital of France\" as referring to Paris. \\n\\nNow, about the population. I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number, but I believe it\\'s a large city. I recall that major cities in France like Paris are known to have populations over 3 million. I\\'ve heard numbers like 2.1 or 2.2 million before. Let me try to think if that makes sense. \\n\\nI remember that France\\'s population in total is around 40 million, so Paris being over 3 million is a significant portion of the country\\'s total population. It\\'s also a very populous city, so maybe 2.1 to 2.2 million sounds right. I don\\'t think the population is extremely high because other cities are also growing, but Paris is definitely one of the bigger ones. \\n\\nWait, does the population of Paris include just the city proper or the greater Paris area? Sometimes people include the suburbs around it as part of the metropolitan area, but for precise data, it\\'s usually the city limits. I think the number I\\'ve heard is just the city, so that should be accurate. \\n\\nIs there any recent data I can cross-reference? Well, I don\\'t have access to external sources, but I\\'ve heard that sometimes it fluctuates a bit, maybe adding a few hundred thousand each year due to births and immigration. So, if I remember correctly, the latest estimate was around 2.17 million in the 2020s, which rounds off to about 2.2 million when simplified. \\n\\nI should make sure I\\'m providing the correct format. The user asked for JSON, so I need to structure it correctly with the right syntax. It should be a JSON object with a key \"capital\" and a key \"population\". So, something like {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2.2}. That looks correct. \\n\\nI also need to make sure the population number is accurate and formatted to one decimal place for clarity. So, using 2.2 million instead of 2,200,000 makes it cleaner in JSON. \\n\\nWait, should I include units? Probably not necessary if it\\'s just a number. JSON doesn\\'t require units, but including it might make it clearer, like {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2.2 million}. But I think most users just want the number without the unit. \\n\\nAlso, I should check if \"capital\" is singular or plural. Since the user wrote \"capital of France,\" I think it refers to Paris, so singular is okay. \\n\\nIs there anything else I need to consider? Maybe the year of the population? But I don\\'t think the user specified a particular year, so I\\'ll just go with the general figure. \\n\\nLet me double-check my facts. I recall that Paris has a population exceeding 2 million, so 2.2 million seems plausible. I also remember that growth in big cities can cause these numbers to change, so it\\'s consistent to have it as approximately 2.2 million. \\n\\nI think I\\'ve covered all the bases here. The answer should be precise but friendly, providing the necessary information without overcomplicating it. Using JSON is the right format because the user requested it, and it\\'s straightforward for data structures. \\n\\nOne last thing, did I format the JSON correctly? Let me write it out again: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2.2}. Yep, that looks good. The keys are strings, and the population is a number. Perfect. I don\\'t see any errors in that. \\n\\nSo, to summarize, the capital of France is Paris, and its population is approximately 2.2 million, formatted in JSON as requested. That should fully answer the user\\'s question accurately and appropriately.\\n</think>\\n\\n{\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2.2}', 'meta_info': {'id': '79fa182a38b1443f95e5f1bd3b5f9e34', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 842, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.635226249694824}}</strong>"
