    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'ee48ccbab4b7421d943bad7995db267a', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 6.034022092819214}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I just got a query from a user asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I should figure out where the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I need to find its population. Hmm, the most recent numbers I recall are that Paris has a population around 2 million people on the streets, but the metropolitan area is much larger. I think the metropolitan area includes neighboring towns like Sub pork and so on, and that number is over 12 million.\\n\\nWait, the user specifically asked for the capital\\'s population, so I should clarify whether they mean the urban area or just the city limits. The urban area is definitely more relevant here, but I should make sure to note both, just in case. So, I\\'ll mention the urban area population as about 12 million and the city proper as 2 million.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"Country,\" \"Capital,\" \"Population,\" and \"CapitalPopulation.\" Under each key, I\\'ll include the appropriate values. For the \"CapitalPopulation,\" I should add nested structures if there are sub-values, like urban area and city proper.\\n\\nI should also summarize the information clearly so that the user understands the data presented. Maybe a brief sentence explaining that Paris is the capital and stating the population figures for both the city and its metropolitan area.\\n\\nNow, I\\'ll make sure my response is clear and not too technical, since I\\'m aiming for a conversational tone. I don\\'t want to use markdown or any formatting, just plain text. I\\'ll also double-check the population numbers to ensure accuracy, perhaps by recalling recent data or using general knowledge since exact numbers can change.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll draft the JSON structure with the necessary keys, insert the correct population figures, and add a concise summary. That should meet the user\\'s needs effectively and provide them with the information they\\'re looking for in an organized and easy-to-read format.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"metropolitan_area\": 12012000,\\n    \"city_proper\": 2021700\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': '9a3f8c3f9d4849b3b6127e431b023bed', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 504, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.620774507522583}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France and its population. I know that Paris is the capital of France, that's pretty much a given. But what about the population? I remember seeing somewhere that Paris is one of the most populous cities in the world, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think. I've heard it's around 2 million people, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should double-check that. I think the population figures can change quite a bit over time due to births, deaths, and migration. So, it's possible that the number I remember is outdated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, I think the population of Paris has been increasing over the years. I recall reading that it's over 2 million now. Maybe around 2.2 million? Or was it 2.1? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact figure. Also, I should consider whether the population figure includes just the city proper or the broader metropolitan area. Sometimes, people refer to the metro area when talking about larger numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, I think the metropolitan area of Paris is much bigger, maybe around 12 million people. But the question specifically asks for the population of the capital, so I guess it's just the city itself. So, probably around 2.1 to 2.2 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also remember that population figures are estimates and can vary depending on the source. Some sources might be more recent than others. So, I should note that the number might have changed since the last census. For example, if the last official count was around 2019, the current population could be a bit higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to consider is whether the population includes all residents or only residents who are registered or something. I think it usually includes everyone living in the city regardless of registration status. So, that shouldn't be an issue here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I can think of some other ways to verify this. I could recall that major cities in France, like Lyon or Marseille, have populations around 1 million, while bigger cities like Marseille are similar. So, Paris being twice that makes sense. But I think there's a city called Lille which is also around 2 million, so Paris might be a bit larger.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also remember that some sources might use different methodologies for counting residents, which can lead to slight discrepancies. For example, some might include people who have moved in recently or adjust for temporary residents. But for the sake of this question, I think providing a general estimate around 2.1 million is acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I think the latest official data from 2021 might have updated this. I believe the population was around 2.17 million in 2021. But since I'm just providing information without specific references, I should probably stick with a commonly accepted estimate, maybe 2.1 to 2.2 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, I can say that the capital of France is Paris, and its population is approximately 2.1 million. I should make sure to present this information in JSON format as requested.\n",
