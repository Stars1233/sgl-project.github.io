    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '888270b801014c028c7d68705af0416e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.508444786071777}}</strong>"

Hmm, I need to make sure I understand what they\\'re asking for. \\n\\nFirst, the capital of France is definitely Paris, right? That\\'s a given. Now, I should provide both general information and the population. For general info, I\\'ll include the administrative details like where it\\'s located, the prefecture, department, area, and elevation. That gives a comprehensive overview.\\n\\nNext, population stats. Current population can vary, so I should mention that it\\'s approximate. Maybe around 2 million people? That sounds about right. Also, the year the data was last updated would be helpful for the user to know the source is recent.\\n\\nPutting this all together in JSON format is straightforward. I\\'ll structure it with an \"capital\" key containing another object with \"general_info\" and \"population\" keys. That way, it\\'s organized and easy to read.\\n\\nI should also keep the language clear and simple, not too technical. The user might be looking for a quick data point, so making sure the JSON is clean and well-formatted is important. Additionally, mentioning that the population is approximate and advising to check official sources for the most up-to-date info adds credibility.\\n\\nWait, should I include the exact year for data accuracy? Yes, that\\'s a good idea. It shows that the information is from a recent year, which makes it more trustworthy. \\n\\nAlright, putting it all together, I\\'ll make sure the JSON is properly formatted with escape characters and all. No markdown, just plain JSON.

      "Next, the format they want it in is JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. So I need to structure the information into a JSON object. Typically, JSON uses key-value pairs, so I can include keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"founded\" if the user is interested in the history.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about the structure. Maybe something like this: {\"city\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2203816, \"founded\": 1753}. That seems straightforward. I can include the year Paris was founded as well, just for completeness, but the user didn't specify that, so I should focus on what they asked for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I mention that the population figure is approximate? It's always good to be transparent. I can add something like \"(approximate figure as of recent estimates)\" to indicate that the number might change over time. That way, the user knows the data is current as of their request.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should ensure that the JSON is properly formatted. Indentation makes it easier to read, so using two spaces for indentation is standard practice. I'll make sure the braces and brackets are correctly placed to avoid any syntax errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, putting it all together: I'll write a JSON object with the city name, population, and the year it was founded. I'll include a comment or a note in the JSON to clarify that the population is approximate. That should cover the user's request comprehensively.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there's any additional information the user might find useful, but since they only asked for the capital's info and population, I'll stick to that. No need to add unnecessary details unless they ask for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, my response will be a properly formatted JSON object with the correct information, clear labeling, and a note about the approximate nature of the population figure. That should meet the user's needs effectively.\n",
