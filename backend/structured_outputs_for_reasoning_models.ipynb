    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

There's 'get_current_date' for the date and time, and 'get_current_weather' for the weather. Both require specific parameters. <br><br>For the date and time, the function needs a timezone parameter. The user is in New York, so I'll set the timezone to 'America/New_York'. <br><br>Next, for the weather, I need the city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state is NY, and the unit is probably Fahrenheit since that's a common request. <br><br>I should structure each function call separately, as per the instructions, so the user can easily understand and use them. I'll make sure to include the parameters in the correct format within each function call.<br><br>Also, I need to remember to add the sources where I got the information from, but since these are built-in functions, I don't have external sources to reference.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '15ad934d4544428285a2e49c3ca6a2bb', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 7.642598628997803}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to provide the information and the population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down step by step because I\\'m not entirely sure where to start. First, I should figure out what the capital of France is. From what I remember, the capital is Paris. But just to be certain, maybe I should double-check that. Wait, I think it\\'s definitely Paris. I\\'ve heard it as the capital multiple times in news and from friends who are French.\\n\\nNow, onto the population. This might be a bit tricky because I know population numbers can change over time. I think the population has been increasing, but I\\'m not sure by how much. I recall that France isn\\'t the most populous country, like China or India, but it\\'s definitely a big country. The population figure I have in mind is around 10 to 15 million. But wait, is it more accurate than that? Hmm, perhaps I should break it down by age group because that might help in understanding the demographics.\\n\\nThe population can be divided into different age groups. I believe the child and young adult population is a significant portion, maybe around 30%. Middle-aged adults could be another 40%, and older adults and the elderly might make up the remaining 30%. This gives a clearer picture of how the population is distributed.\\n\\nAdditionally, I think it\\'s useful to know about language and culture, as these are important aspects of any country. French is the official language, of course. But there are also French dialects spoken in different regions, which enriches the linguistic diversity. Culturally, France is known for its rich history, art, and cuisine. The Eiffel Tower and Paris are symbols of the country. Also, the Paris metropolitan area is mentioned to include neighboring cities, which probably gives a broader picture of the urban area\\'s population.\\n\\nPutting this all together, I need to structure this information in JSON format. JSON uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll list each piece of information as a key with its corresponding value. Let me outline the keys I\\'ll use: \"Capital\", \"Population\", \"Demographics\", and \"Cultural_and_Linguistic scape\". Under each of these, I\\'ll provide the necessary details.\\n\\nFor the \"Capital\" key, I\\'ll simply state that Paris is the capital. Under \"Population\", I\\'ll include a current approximate number, maybe using a recent estimate. The \"Demographics\" section can be a breakdown into age groups. The \"Cultural and Linguistic scape\" should cover aspects like the official language, dialects, and major cultural landmarks.\\n\\nI need to make sure that all the data is up-to-date and accurate. Since population figures can change annually, perhaps I should specify the year of the data or mention that the numbers are approximate. I also need to ensure that the JSON syntax is correct—using quotation marks appropriately, commas in the right places, and proper key formatting.\\n\\nLet me think if there\\'s anything else I might be missing. Maybe including more details about the economic status or other significant factors? But the user specified to focus on the capital, its population, demographics, language, and culture. I think the current information covers all the necessary points.\\n\\nWait, I should also think about how to present percentages in JSON. JSON allows for numbers and strings, so I can include them as numbers without percentage signs, but I\\'ll need to note that the percentages are estimates. Similarly, population figures are approximate, so including a note might be helpful.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure each key with its value. Under \"Demographics\", perhaps I can list each age group as a separate key or present it as a single object with an \"Age_group\" key. In JSON, nesting objects is allowed, so I can have a demographics object that includes the different groups.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or quotation marks. Once everything looks good, I can present the JSON as the answer to the user.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"Capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Population\": \"Approximately 11 million\",\\n  \"Demographics\": {\\n    \"Age_Groups\": {\\n      \"Child and Young Adults (0-24 years)\": 30,\\n      \"Middle-aged Adults (25-64 years)\": 40,\\n      \"Elderly (65+ years)\": 30\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"Cultural_and_Linguistic_Scape\": {\\n    \"Official_Language\": \"French\",\\n    \"Dialects\": \"Various French dialects spoken across regions\",\\n    \"Cultural_Symbols\": [\"Eiffel Tower\", \"Paris\", \"History\", \"Art\", \"Cuisine\"]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON provides a structured overview of the capital of France, including its population, demographic breakdown, and cultural aspects.', 'meta_info': {'id': 'dab391b08968465caf7d0f75bfaf172d', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 1009, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 16.21314525604248}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user is asking for the capital of France along with its population. Hmm, I know that Paris is the capital, but I should double-check that to be sure. Yeah, Paris is definitely the main city where the government and many important institutions are located. Now, about the population. I remember reading somewhere that it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should verify that number.\n",

I believe the population is approximately 2,165,000 as of now. That sounds about right. So, the JSON format should include the key \"capital\" with the name \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number 2165000. I should make sure the formatting is correct, with proper commas and quotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably mention that the population figure is approximate and based on the latest available data. That way, they know it's not an exact number and might have changed since then. Also, maybe I should include the units for the population, like \"thousand\" or \"K\" for abbreviation, to make it clear.\n",
