    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",
    "- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to generate information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format. Hmm, where do I start? Well, I know that Paris is the main city in France, but I'm not exactly sure about all the details. Let me think about what information is typically included about a city's capital.<br><br>First, the name of the city is obviously Paris. Then, the country it's the capital of, which is France. I remember that Paris is the largest city in France, but I'm not sure about its population. I think it's a big city, maybe around 2 million people? I'm not certain, though. I should probably look that up, but since I'm just brainstorming, I'll go with that for now.<br><br>Next, the location. Paris is located in the northern part of France, specifically in the Île-de-France region. I think it's on the Seine River, which is a major river there. The Eiffel Tower is in Paris, so that's a key landmark. I should include that.<br><br>Language-wise, Paris is a center for French culture, so French is definitely the predominant language. I'm not sure about minority languages or dialects, but maybe there are some, but I don't know which ones. I'll just note that French is the main language.<br><br>Cuisine is another aspect. Paris is famous for its food, like baguettes, croissants, and wine. I should mention some of the popular dishes, maybe something like \"Baguette,Croissant, and wine.\"<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has a well-developed public transit system, like the Métro, which is a subway network. I think there are trams and buses too. I should include that the public transport is extensive.<br><br>Economically, Paris is a significant hub. I believe it's home to many multinational companies and financial institutions. Maybe something like \"home to many multinational companies and financial institutions.\"<br><br>Culturally, Paris is rich in museums, art, and historical sites. The Louvre and the Musée d'Histéritage come to mind. Also, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so I should mention that.<br><br>I should also include some notable landmarks. The Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, Notre-Dame, and the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. Maybe the gardens around the Eiffel Tower, like Champ de Mars.<br><br>Now, putting this all together into JSON format. I need to structure it with the key \"capital\" and then include all these details as a value. I'll organize them under different categories for clarity, like \"name,\" \"country,\" \"population,\" \"location,\" \"language,\" \"cuisine,\" \"transportation,\" \"economy,\" \"culture,\" and \"landmarks.\"<br><br>Wait, I'm not sure about the population figure. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should double-check that, but for now, I'll proceed with that number.<br><br>Also, I'm not sure if Paris is the only city in France that's a capital. I think there are others, but Paris is the main one. So, I should specify that Paris is the main capital.<br><br>I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks. Each key should be in quotes, and the entire structure should be an object within the \"capital\" key.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each category as a key, and the corresponding details as values. I'll make sure to include all the points I thought of, but I'll keep it concise and relevant.<br><br>I think that's a good start. Now, I'll format it properly in JSON, ensuring that each key is correctly spelled and the values are accurate based on my understanding.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the information about the capital of France and present it in JSON format. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about France. I know that Paris is the capital, but I should double-check that to be sure. Yeah, Paris is definitely the administrative and cultural center of France.<br><br>Now, I need to gather more details about Paris. Let me think about its location. Paris is located in the northern part of France, right? It's in the Île-de-France region. I remember that it's an island, so that's an important geographical feature. The coordinates are something like 48°51′N 2°28′E. I think that's correct, but I should make sure. Maybe I can visualize it on a map—Paris is in the north, near the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River.<br><br>Next, I should consider the history of Paris. It's been a major city for centuries. I know that during the French Revolution, Paris was the center of the revolution, and it's still a significant cultural and political hub today. It's also a global city, attracting millions of visitors each year.<br><br>Economically, Paris is a major financial and business center. I believe it's home to many multinational corporations and financial institutions. The Paris Stock Exchange comes to mind, and there are a lot of big companies based there. The city is also known for its fashion industry, with some of the world's most famous brands having headquarters in Paris.<br><br>Culturally, Paris is rich with art, literature, and history. The Louvre Museum is one of the world's largest art museums, and it's located in Paris. There's also the Musée d'Orsay, which is another major cultural institution. The city has a vibrant nightlife, with famous bars and clubs. I think places like Le Marais and Montmartre are known for their lively nightlife and artistic scenes.<br><br>Demographically, Paris is a large city, but it's also one of the most densely populated in the world. The metropolitan area covers a vast area, extending beyond the city limits into the outer suburbs. The population is diverse, with people from many different countries and backgrounds living there.<br><br>Transportation-wise, Paris has an extensive public transit system, including the Métro, which is a highly efficient subway network. There are also buses, trams, and trolleys that serve the city. The Seine River has several bridges and ferries that connect different parts of the city.<br><br>I should also mention some notable landmarks. The Eiffel Tower is a must-see, and the Arc de Triomphe is another iconic structure. The Notre-Dame Cathedral is a major religious site, though it's had some recent renovations and changes due to the fire that occurred in 2019.<br><br>In terms of language, Paris is a city where French is the official language, but it's also a multicultural city. People from around the world speak English, Spanish, German, and other languages there, contributing to a very international atmosphere.<br><br>I think I've covered the main points. Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. I'll start with the basic information: name, location, and status. Then, I'll add historical, economic, cultural, demographic, transportation, and notable landmarks sections. Each section will have relevant details under subkeys.<br><br>Wait, I should make sure that the JSON syntax is correct. I'll use proper braces, commas, and quotation marks. Also, I'll ensure that the keys are in lowercase letters as per JSON standards. Let me organize the information step by step.<br><br>First, the capital object will have properties like name, location, and status. Then, each additional section will be an object with its own properties.

The Louvre Museum is another famous spot. The Arc de Triomphe is also iconic. Maybe the Seine River is important too since it\\'s a major river in the city.\\n\\nI should structure this in JSON. So, the main object would have a \"country\" key pointing to \"France,\" and the \"capital\" key pointing to \"Paris.\" Under \"capital,\" I can have an \"info\" array that includes population, landmarks, and maybe some other info like the date it became the capital or the official name.

I\\'ll just put around 978 AD for now.\\n\\nLet me make sure I\\'m not missing anything important. Maybe the official name of the city is \"City of Light,\" which is the official name of Paris.

So, I\\'ll start with that. Next, it\\'s located in France, so that\\'s straightforward.\\n\\nNow, I need to think about the key points about Paris. It\\'s the largest city in France, so that\\'s one point. It\\'s also a major cultural, economic, and political center, so that\\'s another important aspect.\\n\\nI should include the population, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number for Paris. It\\'s around 3 million, I believe, but maybe it\\'s a bit higher. Also, Paris is known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum, so I\\'ll mention those.\\n\\nTransportation-wise, Paris has a metro system, and it\\'s probably the most extensive in Europe. There are subways, trams, and buses covering the city. The Seine River flows through the city-center quarters, contributing to its status as a water-centric area.\\n\\nCombined with other major cities like Lyon and Marseille, Paris is one of the top five largest cities in Europe, right? I think that\\'s correct, but I should double-check that. Paris is also the简称for France, so that\\'s another point to add.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with the country as France and then include the various properties like Population, Language, Capital, etc. I\\'ll make sure each key is in quotes and the string values are properly formatted with commas where needed.\\n\\nI\\'ll also ensure that the JSON structure is valid, with commas separating each key-value pair and the overall structure enclosed in square brackets. Oh, and the country property should be correctly referenced as France, so othercapitals should link to it.\\n\\nWait, is Paris the most populous city in France? I\\'m a bit uncertain, but I think Paris is the largest city, even if the country itself isn\\'t the most populous. France has other very populous cities, so that needs to be accurate.\\n\\nI need to verify each fact, but I\\'ll proceed with the information I have as of now. Hopefully, the JSON comes together correctly.\\n</think>\\n\\n# The Capital of France\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": \"Approx. 3.53 million (2023 estimate)\",\\n    \"lorhibition\": {\\n      \"description\": \"The French language is spoken throughout Paris, and it is the de facto capital language of the country.\",\\n      \"lingua franca\": true\\n    },\\n    \"geography\": {\\n      \"factories\": [\"Eiffel Tower\", \"Louvre Museum\", \"Seine River\", \"Palais Royal\", \"City of邓小平 (non-existent, for reference only)\"],\\n      \"landmarks\": [\"Le Marais\", \"Saint-Gilo\", \"Le Maroc Road\", \"Château de凡尔赛\", \"Musee du Louvre\"],\\n      \"other\": [\"Chanel Corporationstrate\", \"Euler Line\"]\\n    },\\n    \" transportation\": {\\n      \"number_of_subways\": \"One of the most extensive metro systems in the world with over 432 lines\",\\n      \"lines\": \"Approx. 5,976 lines in operation\",\\n      \"stations\": \"13,277 stations\",\\n      \"transport ):other\": \"M пользas, Ttransportarea:trams and buses are also widely used.\",\\n      \"primary Hydrocarbon transportation mode\": \"No main railway network but Express trains connect Paris to other major cities within France\"\\n    },\\n    \"fact\": \" Paris is one of the top five largest cities in Europe and is commonly referred to as \\'la Capitale de la Franche-Comté\\' when discussing its history and legacy.\",\\n    \"other_facts\": [\"It is Visitor-at-IDS\", \"It is coded as \\'Les Tuitions Of质检 masterpiece De Seine\", \"Think of a ParisianQR code: \\'les Tuitions De Seineması M\\tsignature\" \"Parlomashee中医大 שר,’” “ benches and trash cans” “ benches” “ STL”, “ bench” “ st Dav])\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'meta_info': {'id': 'f30921be5e704535aac863c522bb73f2', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 872, 'cached_tokens': 19, 'e2e_latency': 8.611674547195435}}</strong>"

They want the information of the capital of France in JSON format, then convert that into a JSONP object. Also, they need a JSON array with 5 different cities in France, each having population and area. Finally, they want a JSON object that combines both the capital info and the array of cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital. So, the JSON for the capital should include its name, country, population, area, and whether it's the capital.

      "  \"area\": 100000, // Again, approximate values.\n",
      "  \"capital\": true\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to convert this into a JSONP object. JSONP typically wraps the JSON in a function and adds a \"func\" key. So, it would look like:\n",

      "{\n",
      "  \"func\": function() {\n",
      "    return {\n",
      "      \"name\": \"Paris\",\n",

      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but JSONP often uses a function that returns the JSON object. So, the structure is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, moving on to the array of 5 cities in France. I need to list 5 cities, each with their population and area. I should pick well-known cities to make it accurate. Let me think of some major cities in France:\n",

      "2. Marseille\n",
      "3. Toulouse\n",
      "4. Lille\n",
      "5. Nîmes\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to find their approximate populations and areas. I might not have exact numbers, so I'll have to estimate or use known approximate values.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Lyon: Population around 400,000, area about 100 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Marseille: Population around 600,000, area about 150 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Toulouse: Population around 300,000, area about 120 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Lille: Population around 450,000, area about 110 square kilometers.\n",
      "- Nîmes: Population around 250,000, area about 80 square kilometers.\n",

After that, I have to create a JSON array with five different cities in France, each including their population and area. Finally, I need to combine both the capital info and the array into a single JSON object.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me recall what the capital of France is. I think it's Paris. Yes, Paris is the capital city of France. Now, I need to find the population and area of Paris. I'm not exactly sure about the current numbers, but I remember that Paris has a large population and a significant area. Let me check my memory: I think the population is around 2 million and the area is about 105 square kilometers. I should verify these numbers to be accurate, but for the sake of this exercise, I'll go with these figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to represent this information in JSON format. The structure should include the name, country, population, and area. So, the JSON object for the capital would look like this:\n",

      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, moving on to the JSONP object. JSONP typically involves wrapping the JSON object in a function and providing a callback. The syntax is usually function() { return JSON; }. So, converting the above JSON into a JSONP object would involve adding a function wrapper. It would look something like:\n",

      "Now, onto the second part: creating a JSON array of five different cities in France, each with their population and area. I need to choose five cities. Let me think of some major cities in France. I know Paris, but I need four more. Maybe Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, and Nice? Or maybe I should include some other cities to make it diverse. Let me check their populations and areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Paris: As mentioned, population around 2 million, area about 105 km².\n",
      "2. Lyon: I believe Lyon has a population of around 400,000 and an area of about 100 km².\n",
      "3. Marseille: Population is around 1.5 million, area about 100 km².\n",
      "4. Toulouse: Population is around 300,000, area about 100 km².\n",
      "5. Nice: Population is around 600,000, area about 200 km².\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should verify these numbers because I might be off. For example, Nice's area is actually larger, maybe around 200 km², but the population is a bit lower. Let me adjust accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the JSON array would look like this:\n",
      "\n",

      "First, I should recall what the capital of Ireland is. I'm pretty sure it's Dublin. Yeah, that's right. Dublin is the largest city in Ireland and serves as its administrative capital, even though Ireland is a constitutional monarchy and doesn't have a federal capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll need to decide which keys to use. The user mentioned population, area, and official language, so I can include those. Also, since the capital is Dublin, I should include that as a key as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the keys I'll use are probably \"capital\", \"population\", \"area\", and \"official_language\". Each of these will have their respective values. Let me make sure about the numbers. The population is approximately 5 million, so I'll write that as 5000000. The area is about 9,400 square kilometers, so that's 9400. The official language is English, so that's straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON structure should look like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": \"Dublin\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 5000000,\n",
      "  \"area\": 9400,\n",
      "  \"official_language\": \"English\"\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that covers everything the user asked for. They wanted the JSON with key-value pairs, and I included the capital, population, area, and official language. I should double-check if there are any other details they might need, but based on the information given, this should be sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user also mentioned that the population is approximately 5 million, the area is about 9,400 square kilometers, and the official language is English. I included all of these in the JSON. I don't think I need to add anything else unless they specify more details, but they didn't ask for more information, so I think this is all that's needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure that the JSON syntax is correct. The keys are in double quotes, the string values are in double quotes, and the numbers are without quotes. The commas are in the right places, and the structure is properly formatted. I don't see any syntax errors here.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to summarize, the JSON object will have four key-value pairs: capital as \"Dublin\", population as 5000000, area as 9400, and official_language as \"English\". This should fulfill the user's request accurately.\n",

      "Generated text: Alright, so I need to figure out the capital of France using the information provided in the JSON format. Let me start by looking at the JSON data given. The JSON object has a key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\". That seems straightforward, but I should make sure I'm not missing anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should recall what I know about France's geography. I know that Paris is definitely a major city in France and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" It's the political and cultural center, so it makes sense that it's the capital. But I don't want to just rely on my memory; I should cross-check it with the JSON data provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the JSON, the key \"capital\" is assigned the value \"Paris.\" This is a direct statement, so unless there's some trick or hidden information, it should be correct. However, I should think about whether the JSON structure might be hiding something. Sometimes, JSON can have nested objects or arrays, but in this case, it's a simple key-value pair, so it's pretty straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there's any possibility that the JSON could be incorrect or outdated. For example, maybe in a different version of the JSON data, the capital might have changed? I know that capitals can change, but as of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Paris remains the capital of France. So unless there's a recent update to the JSON data that I'm not aware of, this should still hold true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to think about is whether the JSON could have any additional fields or attributes that might provide more context. In this case, there are no other keys listed, so the only relevant information is the \"capital\" key with the value \"Paris.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I could also think about how JSON works in general. It's a data interchange format that's used widely, so if the capital is listed there, it's likely reliable. JSON structures data in a way that's easy for both humans and machines to read, which reduces the chance of errors unless the data itself is incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I can think about other sources to corroborate this information. For example, looking up the official website of the French government or referring to reputable geographical databases would confirm that Paris is indeed the capital. But since I'm only relying on the JSON provided, I have to take that as the source.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if the JSON might have been generated programmatically. Sometimes, programs can output incorrect data, but again, without more context, I can't verify that. So, I have to assume that the JSON is accurate unless there's a clear reason to doubt it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, based on the JSON provided, the key \"capital\" has the value \"Paris,\" which aligns with my existing knowledge. There's no indication of any errors or additional information that would suggest otherwise. Therefore, the conclusion is that the capital of France, as per the given JSON, is Paris.\n",
