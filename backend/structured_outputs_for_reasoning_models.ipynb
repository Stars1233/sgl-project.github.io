    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The key should be \"capital\" with the name \"Paris,\" and another key for \"population.\" I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted as an integer in the JSON.<br><br>I also need to present this clearly. Maybe I should write it out in the response, showing the JSON structure so the user can see exactly what they'll get. That way, they can easily copy it or use it in their application.<br><br>I wonder if the user is a developer working on a project that requires population data. They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': 'd8b2afa984824e58ad54a709dfc00cca', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.85196328163147}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': \"Alright, so I need to figure out the population of the capital of France. First off, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty much ingrained in my consciousness now. So, the next step is to find out what the current population of Paris is. I remember hearing that Paris is a really big city, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact number.\\n\\nI guess I'll start by recalling any recent data I might have come across. I think I heard something about it being over 3 million people. Wait, but is that correct? I seem to remember reading that Paris has grown quite a bit over the years, especially with the influx of new residents in recent decades. Maybe it's in the mid-3 million range now.\\n\\nAnother thing I should consider is whether Paris has a larger metropolitan area or just the administrative capital. Sometimes, when people talk about the capital, they might refer to the broader urban area rather than just the administrative center. For instance, the combined population of Paris and itsGreaterParis might be higher. I think I've heard estimates mentioning over 22 million people in that bigger area.\\n\\nBut wait, the user specifically asked for the population of the capital, which I believe is Paris itself, not the entire metropolitan region. So, sticking to that, I'm pretty sure the population is in the 3.1 million range. I remember reading a fact somewhere that says the population of Paris is approximately 3,200,000. That seems about right based on what I remember.\\n\\nHowever, I should double-check this to be accurate. Let me think if there are any recent censuses or estimates that might have updated this number. I think the most recent data from the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) would be a reliable source. But since I don't have real-time access, I'll go with what I vaguely remember or have been taught.\\n\\nAlso, I should consider that populations can fluctuate due to various factors like births, deaths, and migrations. So, the number might vary slightly from year to year. But for general purposes, saying that the capital of France has a population of around 3.1 million seems safe.\\n\\nAdditionally, I might want to mention that this is an approximate figure and that for the most precise information, consulting official sources like INSEE or recent demographic reports would be best. But the user didn't ask for that, so I can stick to providing the number.\\n\\nIn summary, after going through my memory and trying to recall recent data, I believe the population of Paris is approximately 3.1 million people. I'm pretty confident about this, but if I were writing a formal report, I'd look it up to confirm the exact number.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe population of the capital of France, Paris, is approximately 3,100,000. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, consulting official sources such as the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) is recommended.\", 'meta_info': {'id': 'e02d067db5924c44b27f713a9f12de01', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 621, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.8237926959991455}}</strong>"
