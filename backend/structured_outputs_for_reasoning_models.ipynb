    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

They might need it in JSON for integration or analysis. So providing the exact format they asked for is important. I should also make sure the response is concise and to the point, without any extra fluff.<br><br>Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the date of the population count, but the user didn't specify that. I'll stick to the most recent data available. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is valid, so using proper syntax with quotes and commas.<br><br>In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the correct capital name and population number, making sure it's accurate and in the format the user requested.

Also, the user wants it in JSON format, so I need to structure it properly with the key \"capital\" and the value as a string. <br><br>I wonder if the user is a student working on a project or maybe a developer needing data for an app. Either way, providing the correct and up-to-date information is crucial. Maybe they also need this for a presentation or a report, so accuracy is key. <br><br>I should also consider if there are any other details they might need, like the area or the time zone, but the user specifically asked for population. So I'll stick to that.

From the instructions, there are two relevant functions: get_current_weather and get_current_date.<br><br>First, I'll determine the date and time using get_current_date. It requires a timezone parameter. The user mentioned New York, which is in the 'America/New_York' timezone. So, I'll format the function call as <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I need the city and state. The city is New York, and the state abbreviation is NY. The unit isn't specified, but since the user didn't mention it, I might default to Celsius or Fahrenheit, but perhaps it's better to check if the function allows specifying. Wait, the function's parameter 'unit' is optional with an enum of ['celsius', 'fahrenheit']. So, maybe I should include it. But the user hasn't specified, so perhaps I should include it as optional. Alternatively, I can note that it's optional in the description.<br><br>Wait, the function description says 'unit' is optional with enum ['celsius', 'fahrenheit']. So, the user can omit it if they don't care, but perhaps it's better to include it as optional. However, since the user didn't mention it, maybe it's safer to leave it out. So, the get_current_weather function would require 'city' and 'state', which are provided as New York and NY.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll make two separate function calls: one for the date and time, and another for the weather. Each will be on separate lines as per the user's instruction to put the entire function call on one line but with each function in its own message.<br><br>I also need to format the JSON correctly, ensuring that the keys and values are properly quoted and structured. For example, for get_current_date, the JSON parameter is {\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}.<br><br>Finally, I'll structure the response with each function call in its own message, following the specified format. I should also include a reminder about the required parameters to make it clear for the user.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"celsius\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number I just thought of.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\\'t ask for that, I\\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user\\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations. Either way, providing accurate and concise data is key.\\n\\nI should ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted to avoid any errors when the user tries to use it. No markdown, just plain JSON. That way, it\\'s easy to copy and paste into their code or document.\\n\\nIn summary, I identified the capital, found the population number, structured it into a JSON object, and made sure the syntax is correct. I think this should meet the user\\'s needs effectively.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2150000\\n}', 'meta_info': {'id': '47c5d438173c42d7a3ab03b30d4d6989', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.799420356750488}}</strong>"

Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this. Let me break it down.\\n\\nFirst, the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s a fact I remember, but just to be sure, maybe I can double-check once I get the info ready. But for now, I\\'ll proceed with what I know.\\n\\nThey want the information in JSON format, which is a data interchange format used in various applications. So I should structure it in a way that\\'s easy to read and use, like a code block in a response.\\n\\nI need to include the city name, its Deutsche Bahn station, population, and population growth rate. Wait, the population number I believe is approximate because it can change yearly. I last heard it around 3.5 million but I should make sure to confirm.\\n\\nNow, structuring the JSON, it should have a key for \"city\" with the name, another key for \"deutsch_bahn\" with the station, \"population\" as a number, and \"population_growth_rate\" as a percentage. Using proper JSON syntax is crucial here—commas in the right places, double quotes for keys, and correct brackets.\\n\\nI also need to include a note that the population is approximate and might change. That way, the user knows it\\'s an estimate and not a fixed figure.\\n\\nLet me think if I\\'m missing anything. Maybe I should explain briefly what JSON is, but the user didn\\'t ask for an explanation, so perhaps it\\'s better to keep it concise unless they ask for it.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON structure should look like this. I\\'ll make sure the city name is \"Paris\", the station is \"Place du Abbey\", the population is 3500000, and the growth rate is 1.2%. Also, the note about the population being approximate.\\n\\nI should also format it correctly, with each key properly quoted and commas in the right places to avoid syntax errors. Alright, I think that covers everything the user asked for.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"deutsch_bahn\": \"Place du Abbey\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"population_growth_rate\": 1.2\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNote: The population of 3,500,000 is approximate and may vary slightly depending on the source.', 'meta_info': {'id': 'edf14ce9b85f42f58d897a261a152cf5', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens': 529, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.108309745788574}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user is asking for the capital of France and its population in JSON format. Hmm, I should make sure I get all the details right. First, I need to recall what the capital of France is. I think it's Paris, right? Yeah, that's correct. Paris is both the capital and the most populous city in France, which is a big point to mention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the population. I'm not exactly sure of the current number, but I know it's in the millions. Maybe around 2 million? Wait, no, that seems low. I think it's over 2 million. Let me think... I believe it's approximately 2,150,000 as of 2023. I should verify that, but since I'm just recalling, I'll go with that number. It's important to provide an accurate figure, so I hope that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user also specified the format as JSON. So, I need to structure the response in JSON syntax. They probably want it to be clear and easy to parse, maybe for integration into another application or for data processing. So, I'll create a JSON object with the key \"capital\" containing the city name and \"population\" containing the number, including commas for readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": \"2,150,000\"}. That should cover the user's request effectively. I don't see any additional information they might need, but if they ask for more details later, I can expand it. For now, this should suffice.\n",
