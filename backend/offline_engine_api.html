<h1>Offline Engine API<a class="headerlink" href="#Offline-Engine-API" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>SGLang provides a direct inference engine without the need for an HTTP server, especially for use cases where additional HTTP server adds unnecessary complexity or overhead. Here are two general use cases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Offline Batch Inference</p></li>
<li><p>Custom Server on Top of the Engine</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This document focuses on the offline batch inference, demonstrating four different inference modes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Non-streaming synchronous generation</p></li>
<li><p>Streaming synchronous generation</p></li>
<li><p>Non-streaming asynchronous generation</p></li>
<li><p>Streaming asynchronous generation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can easily build a custom server on top of the SGLang offline engine. A detailed example working in a python script can be found in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/examples/runtime/engine/custom_server.py">custom_server</a>.</p>
