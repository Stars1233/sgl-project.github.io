<h1>Offline Engine API<a class="headerlink" href="#Offline-Engine-API" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>SGLang provides a direct inference engine without the need for an HTTP server, especially for use cases where additional HTTP server adds unnecessary complexity or overhead. Here are two general use cases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Offline Batch Inference</p></li>
<li><p>Custom Server on Top of the Engine</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This document focuses on the offline batch inference, demonstrating four different inference modes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Non-streaming synchronous generation</p></li>
<li><p>Streaming synchronous generation</p></li>
<li><p>Non-streaming asynchronous generation</p></li>
<li><p>Streaming asynchronous generation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can easily build a custom server on top of the SGLang offline engine. A detailed example working in a python script can be found in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/examples/runtime/engine/custom_server.py">custom_server</a>.</p>

As a member of the [Tribe Name] Nation, I have a deep understanding of the cultural, historical, and environmental significance of our lands and resources. I am concerned that the proposed project/legislation/initiative would have a negative impact on our way of life, our cultural practices, and our ability to preserve our traditions for future generations.

Prompt: The capital of France is
Generated text: , of course, Paris. But did you know that the second-largest city in France is also the capital of a region that was once a powerful state? Lyon is a city with a rich history, beautiful architecture, and a vibrant cultural scene. It&#39;s a city that&#39;s steeped in tradition, yet has a modern and dynamic vibe. Let&#39;s explore some of the top things to do in Lyon!
1. Explore the Roman Ruins
Lyon has a long history dating back to the Roman era. The city was an important center of trade and commerce during the Roman Empire, and many of its ancient ruins remain intact today. The

Prompt: The future of AI is
Generated text:  uncertain. But one thing is clear: we need more AI experts.
The demand for AI expertise has never been higher, yet there are significant barriers to entry. AI and machine learning (ML) require specialized skills, and the field is rapidly evolving. As a result, there are not enough qualified professionals to meet the growing needs of businesses and governments. This mismatch between supply and demand is leading to a skills gap, which can hinder innovation and limit the potential of AI.
Several factors contribute to the AI skills gap:
1. Limited access to education and training: The cost of quality AI education and training can be prohibitively expensive, limiting access
