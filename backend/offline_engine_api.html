<h1>Offline Engine API<a class="headerlink" href="#Offline-Engine-API" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>SGLang provides a direct inference engine without the need for an HTTP server, especially for use cases where additional HTTP server adds unnecessary complexity or overhead. Here are two general use cases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Offline Batch Inference</p></li>
<li><p>Custom Server on Top of the Engine</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This document focuses on the offline batch inference, demonstrating four different inference modes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Non-streaming synchronous generation</p></li>
<li><p>Streaming synchronous generation</p></li>
<li><p>Non-streaming asynchronous generation</p></li>
<li><p>Streaming asynchronous generation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can easily build a custom server on top of the SGLang offline engine. A detailed example working in a python script can be found in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/examples/runtime/engine/custom_server.py">custom_server</a>.</p>

Prompt: Hello, my name is
Generated text:  Dominiq and I am a passionate traveler and writer. I have been working as a travel writer for many years, traveling to over 40 countries and writing for numerous travel publications.
My passion for travel started when I was a child, growing up in a multicultural family. My parents were from different parts of the world, and I was exposed to different cultures and traditions from a young age. This sparked my curiosity and love for exploring new places and meeting new people.
Over the years, I have traveled to many parts of the world, from the bustling cities of Asia to the ancient ruins of Europe, and from the vibrant markets of Africa

Prompt: The future of AI is
Generated text:  not what you think
By Marc Perton, published in AI for Business
The notion of a robot uprising or a future where artificial intelligence (AI) surpasses human intelligence is often portrayed in science fiction. While these depictions can be compelling, they are largely exaggerated and don&#39;t reflect the current state of AI research. In reality, the future of AI is more nuanced and complex.
Here are a few reasons why the future of AI is not what you might think:
1. AI is a tool, not a replacement: AI is designed to augment human capabilities, not replace them. AI systems can process vast amounts of data, perform

The AI landscape is rapidly evolving, with the convergence of multiple technologies, such as cloud computing, edge computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain, creating a powerful platform for AI. This platform is enabling AI to become more pervasive, efficient, and effective.
