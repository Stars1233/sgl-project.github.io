<h1>Offline Engine API<a class="headerlink" href="#Offline-Engine-API" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>SGLang provides a direct inference engine without the need for an HTTP server, especially for use cases where additional HTTP server adds unnecessary complexity or overhead. Here are two general use cases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Offline Batch Inference</p></li>
<li><p>Custom Server on Top of the Engine</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This document focuses on the offline batch inference, demonstrating four different inference modes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Non-streaming synchronous generation</p></li>
<li><p>Streaming synchronous generation</p></li>
<li><p>Non-streaming asynchronous generation</p></li>
<li><p>Streaming asynchronous generation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can easily build a custom server on top of the SGLang offline engine. A detailed example working in a python script can be found in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/examples/runtime/engine/custom_server.py">custom_server</a>.</p>

Prompt: Hello, my name is
Generated text:  Jo and I am a volunteer with the Waltham Forest Volunteer Centre. I am 51 and have been a volunteer for over 5 years. I was previously a civil servant and before that worked in retail management. I decided to volunteer after my children left home and I was looking for a way to give something back to the community.

I currently volunteer at a local library, helping with book sales and providing information to visitors. I also help out with a community project that supports refugees and asylum seekers.

The gardens were created in the 17th century and are named after the Luxembourg Palace, which was built on the site of a former abbey. The gardens are filled with beautiful fountains, statues, and walking paths, and offer stunning views of the city.

Meet the brainchild of Dr. Stuart Russell, a leading AI researcher and professor, who has been working on developing an AI system capable of outperforming humans in a wide range of tasks. The AI, named &#34;AlphaGo Zero,&#34; has been trained using a combination of machine learning and game theory to learn from its own mistakes and improve its performance over time.
AlphaGo Zero is a revolutionary AI system that has been designed to play the game of Go, a complex strategy board game that has been a benchmark for AI research for decades. But this AI
