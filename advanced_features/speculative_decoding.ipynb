    "To enable EAGLE speculative decoding the following parameters are relevant:\n",
    "* `speculative_draft_model_path`: Specifies draft model. This parameter is required.\n",
    "* `speculative_num_steps`: Depth of autoregressive drafting. Increases speculation range but risks rejection cascades. Default is 5.\n",
    "* `speculative_eagle_topk`: Branching factor per step. Improves candidate diversity, will lead to higher acceptance rate, but more lead to higher memory/compute consumption. Default is 4.\n",
    "* `speculative_num_draft_tokens`: Maximum parallel verification capacity. Allows deeper tree evaluation but will lead to higher GPU memory usage. Default is 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters are the same for EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the best combinations of these parameters with [bench_speculative.py](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/scripts/playground/bench_speculative.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the documentation below, we set `--cuda-graph-max-bs` to be a small value for faster engine startup. For your own workloads, please tune the above parameters together with `--cuda-graph-max-bs`, `--max-running-requests`, `--mem-fraction-static` for the best performance. "

France is a country in Europe, right? I remember that Paris is a major city there. But wait, is Paris actually the capital? I think it is, but maybe I should double-check to be sure. Sometimes people can get confused with other big cities like London or Rome, but those are capitals of the UK and Italy respectively.\\n\\nLet me think about other regions within France. Are there any republics or regions that might have their own capitals? For example, the French Republic vs. other republics within France? No, I think France is a single republic, and the capital is Paris. The Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a famous landmark. Also, the Arc de Triomphe, Notre-Dame Cathedral... all those are in Paris. \\n\\nWait, could there be any recent changes? Sometimes capitals can change for various reasons, political or otherwise. But to my knowledge, Paris has been the capital of France since its establishment. The city was founded in the 12th century, became a major medieval capital, and has remained the capital ever since. \\n\\nAnother point: the government buildings. The President of France resides in the Élysée Palace, which is in Paris. The National Assembly (Parliament) is also located in Paris. So all the key governmental institutions are based there. \\n\\nMaybe some people might confuse it with other cities like Lille, Lyon, or Marseille, which are important cities but not the capital. For instance, Lyon is known for its cuisine, Marseille is a major port, but neither is the capital. \\n\\nAlso, the official currency of France is the euro (€), and while it\\'s not directly related to the capital, but major cities like Paris are where the European Central Bank is located? Wait, no. The European Central Bank is in Frankfurt, Germany. Paris has its own central bank, I think. \\n\\nLet me also confirm the time zones. Paris is in the Central European Time (CET) zone, which aligns with it being the capital. If another city were the capital, they might be in a different time zone, but that\\'s not the case here. \\n\\nCultural aspects: The Louvre Museum, which is one of the world\\'s most famous museums, is located in Paris. The故宫 (Palace Museum) in Beijing is in China, so not relevant here. The OECD总部 (Headquarters) is in Paris as well. International organizations often have their headquarters in major capitals. \\n\\nAirports: Paris Charles de Gaulle is one of the busiest international airports, which makes sense for the capital. Other major cities have their own international airports, but Paris is consistently top in terms of passenger traffic. \\n\\nHistorical context: Napoleon Bonaparte\\'s empire had Paris as its capital, and even before that, during the French Revolution, the capital was Paris. So historically, it\\'s been the seat of government. \\n\\nIs there any official source that states Paris as the capital? Checking in mind, the French government\\'s website, or official tourism sites, they all list Paris as the capital. For example, the Visit France website mentions Paris as the capital city. \\n\\nPossible pitfalls: Maybe someone might confuse the capital of France with another country\\'s capital, like South Korea\\'s Seoul or the US\\'s Washington D.C. But in this case, the question is specifically about France, so Paris is the clear answer. \\n\\nAlternatively, could there be a new development, like a decentralized administrative region where the capital is shared? France has something called the Réunion region, but it\\'s an overseas region, and its capital is Saint-Denis. But that\\'s not the national capital. Similarly, other overseas regions like Martinique have their own capitals, but again, not the national one. \\n\\nIn terms of administrative divisions, France is divided into regions, but the capital is an exception, located in the Île-de-France region. Paris is not part of any regular department but is its own region. \\n\\nSo, putting all this together, every indication points to Paris being the capital of France. I don\\'t recall any recent changes or announcements about moving the capital. It\\'s a well-established fact. Therefore, the answer should be Paris.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is **Paris**. This historic city has been the political and cultural heart of France since its founding, home to iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre Museum. It is also the seat of the French government, including the President\\'s residence (Élysée Palace) and the national assembly. Paris is globally recognized for its art, cuisine, and international institutions, solidifying its status as the nation\\'s capital. \\n\\n**Answer:** Paris.', 'reasoning_content': None, 'tool_calls': None}, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'matched_stop': 151645}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 26, 'total_tokens': 1019, 'completion_tokens': 993, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 0}, 'metadata': {'weight_version': 'default'}}</strong>"

    "EAGLE process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Within EAGLE the draft model predicts the next feature vector, i.e. the last hidden state of the original LLM, using the feature sequence $(f_1, ..., f_k)$ and the token sequence $(t_2, ..., t_{k+1})$. \n",
    "- The next token is then sampled from $p_{k+2}=\\text{LMHead}(f_{k+1})$. Afterwards, the two sequences are extended in a tree style—branching out multiple potential continuations, with the branching factor per step controlled by the `speculative_eagle_topk` parameter—to ensure a more coherent connection of context, and are given as input again.\n",
    "- EAGLE-2 additionally uses the draft model to evaluate how probable certain branches in the draft tree are, dynamically stopping the expansion of unlikely branches. After the expansion phase, reranking is employed to select only the top `speculative_num_draft_tokens` final nodes as draft tokens.\n",
    "- EAGLE-3 removes the feature prediction objective, incorporates low and mid-layer features, and is trained in an on-policy manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enhances drafting accuracy by operating on the features instead of tokens for more regular inputs and passing the tokens from the next timestep additionally to minimize randomness effects from sampling. Furthermore the dynamic adjustment of the draft tree and selection of reranked final nodes increases acceptance rate of draft tokens further. For more details see [EAGLE-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16858) and [EAGLE-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01840) paper.\n",
