    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '250a999f09f7404ca1656f1b0dafb9f0', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.418264627456665}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out what the capital of France is. From what I remember, Paris is the capital. That\\'s pretty much set, right? But just to be thorough, I should make sure. Maybe I can double-check online, but since the user is asking for the capital, it\\'s a standard fact, so I think it\\'s safe to go with Paris without hesitation.\\n\\nNext, they want the population. Population figures can vary, so I should look up the most recent data. I think the population of Paris is around 2.1 million people. Wait, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the latest number. Let me try to recall any recent data. I believe it\\'s been stable around that number, but I could be wrong. Alternatively, maybe it\\'s 2.2 million? I\\'m a little uncertain here. Maybe I should check a reliable source, but for now, I\\'ll stick with 2.1 million since it\\'s a commonly cited number.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information formatted in JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, right? It\\'s a lightweight data-interchange format that\\'s easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. So I need to structure this as a JSON object with specific keys. The keys they specified are \"country\", \"city\", and \"population\". So the country will be \"France\", the city is \"Paris\", and the population is the number we discussed.\\n\\nI need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct. The keys should be in double quotes, and the values as well, except for strings and numbers. Wait, but in this case, country and city are strings, and population is a number, so that makes sense. The JSON structure should be like {\"country\": \"France\", \"city\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2100000}.\\n\\nWait, but is 2.1 million written as 2100000? Or should it be a float like 2100000.0? Well, in JSON, numbers can be integers or floats. Since population counts are typically whole numbers, I think using an integer is fine.\\n\\nNow, should I include any units for the population? The user didn\\'t specify, so maybe it\\'s just the number without units since it\\'s standard to present populations without units in JSON unless specified otherwise.\\n\\nIs the user expecting this in a specific version of JSON? Probably not, as JSON doesn\\'t enforce any version unless specified, so the basic structure should suffice.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider: is there any additional information the user might need? Just the country, city, and population, so the keys provided are sufficient.\\n\\nPotential mistakes I might make: Maybe I confused Paris with another city, or maybe thought of a different capital, but no, I think I\\'m confident with Paris. Also, ensuring the JSON syntax is correct. Let me write it out again: {\"country\": \"France\", \"city\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2100000}. That looks good to me.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should also consider rounding. If the actual number is higher, like 2.15 million, should I round it to 2.2 million? The user didn\\'t specify, so I\\'ll stick with the commonly known figure of 2.1 million to keep it accurate.\\n\\nAlso, in case the population figure has changed recently, but without up-to-the-minute data, it\\'s better to provide a reliable, recent number. I think 2021 or 2022 data might be available, but I\\'m not sure. For the sake of this response, 2.1 million is acceptable.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object is straightforward with the keys and the correct values. I think that\\'s all the user needs.\\n\\nWait, did I answer everything? They asked for the information and population, so I covered both. Also, they wanted JSON format, so including that is necessary. I think that\\'s comprehensive.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2100000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648,
