    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out the information and population of the capital of France. First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's a given, but just to be thorough, I should make sure that's correct. I remember that Paris is the main city in France and it's where all the important government offices are located, so that must be the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, for the population. I think Paris is one of the most populous cities in the world, maybe even in France. But I'm not exactly sure about the current number. I recall that it's in the hundreds of millions. Wait, no, that can't be right because France's total population is around 40 million, so Paris can't be that big. Maybe in the tens of millions? I think I've heard it's around 12 million. Let me try to remember any recent statistics or news about Paris's population. I think it's been increasing, but not by a huge amount recently. So, I'll go with approximately 12 million people living in Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there's any official data I can reference. From what I know, the official population estimate for Paris is around 12.5 million in 2023. That seems reasonable. It's a bit over a decade since I last checked, but I don't think the population has increased dramatically. Maybe it's around 12.3 million. I'll go with 12.4 million to keep it a bit more precise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the capital is Paris, and its population is approximately 12.4 million. I should present this in JSON format as the user requested. So the JSON should have a key for \"capital\" and another for \"population.\" Let me structure that correctly. The keys should be \"capital\" and \"population,\" and the values should be the respective information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should the population be an exact figure or an estimate? Since population figures can change yearly and might not be exact, I think it's better to provide an approximate number. So I'll keep it around 12.4 million. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should make sure that the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values should be numerical where appropriate. So the JSON would look like:\n",
