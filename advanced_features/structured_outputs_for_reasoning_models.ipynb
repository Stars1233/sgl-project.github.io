    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets.

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I just got a user asking for the information and population of France\\'s capital in JSON format. Hmm, okay, France\\'s capital is Paris, right? I remember that from school and various media. So the first thing I need to do is figure out the correct and most recent population number for Paris. Population data can change over time, so it\\'s important to have an accurate figure. I think the population is around 2 million, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. Let me try to recall or think about any sources that might give me a precise figure.\\n\\nWait, I think sometimes official sources update the data, so maybe it\\'s a bit higher or lower than my initial thought. I should probably look up some recent statistics. From what I remember, the population of Paris is roughly 2.1 or 2.2 million. But to be precise, I should confirm the exact number to ensure accuracy. Maybe around 2.16 million? I\\'m a bit fuzzy on the exact figure.\\n\\nOkay, so I should present this information in a JSON format as requested. JSON is a data interchange format, so I\\'ll structure it with a key-value pairs for \"capital\" and \"population.\" The capital is straightforward, it\\'s Paris. The population number I should include is the most recent and accurate, which I think is approximately 2,164,267 people as of the latest data. I can denote that in the JSON as using commas for separation and correct syntax to avoid errors.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user is asking for anything else. They just asked for population and information, so maybe giving some additional stats could be helpful. Do they know the population density? Or maybe the area of Paris? Including that could provide more comprehensive information. But since they only asked for population and the capital, maybe I should stick to that unless I can infer more details.\\n\\nAnother thing is the date of the population figure. If I include it, should it be in quotes or as a date object? Probably as a string if it\\'s a date. But since the population numbers are static, maybe just the year, like 2022. However, I should check if the current data is updated because population changes annually.\\n\\nWait, if the user is using this information for something like a report or a project, accuracy is key. So maybe I should also mention that the figure is approximate or that it\\'s based on the latest census. That way, there\\'s no confusion if the number varies slightly.\\n\\nI wonder, does the user need the population by age group? Demographics can be useful, but unless they specifically asked, I shouldn\\'t include it. It\\'s better to stick to the basics unless they delve deeper.\\n\\nAlso, considering formatting, using proper JSON syntax with quotation marks, colons, and commas correctly is essential to avoid errors if it\\'s used programmatically. So I\\'ll make sure the JSON is well-structured.\\n\\nIs there any other information related to the capital that could be relevant? Maybe the administrative region, government, or notable landmarks? Since they only asked for population and information on the capital, perhaps sticking to the main points is better. Unless they specify more details, it\\'s safer to limit the response to what\\'s asked.\\n\\nWait, the user might not just be an average person; they could be a student, researcher, or even a web developer integrating this data. If it\\'s the latter, providing reliable JSON without any formatting issues is crucial. So the JSON should be clean, easy to parse, and accurate in its information.\\n\\nIn summary, my steps are:\\n1. Determine the capital of France, which is Paris.\\n2. Find the most recent and accurate population figure, approximately 2,164,267 in 2022.\\n3. Format this information into a JSON object with keys for capital and population.\\n4. Ensure proper JSON syntax for readability and correctness.\\n5. Optionally note that the figure is approximate or based on the latest data.\\n\\nThat should cover everything the user is asking for in a clear and concise manner.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n

      "\n",
      "First, I need to determine which city is the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's a given. Now, I need to gather the necessary information about Paris, such as its population. I should also include other relevant details they might find useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Population data can be tricky because it changes over time. I think the latest available data from 2023 might be accurate. According to recent sources, Paris has a population of approximately 2,209,000 people. I should make sure this number is up-to-date and reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"City,\" \"Population,\" \"Area,\" and \"Founded.\" For \"City,\" it's straightforward—Paris. \"Population\" will be the number I found, but I should probably represent it as a number without commas for JSON compatibility, so 2209000. \n",
      "\n",
      "Area is usually in square kilometers, so I'll include that as well, maybe around 105 square kilometers. The year the city was founded is 1554, so that's another key. I should also add a description that briefly explains what Paris is like to make the response more informative.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should double-check all the facts to ensure accuracy. Maybe look up the population again to confirm it's correct. Also, verify the founding year because I'm not entirely sure if it's 1554 or another year. Once I'm confident in all the data, I'll format it into a JSON structure and present it to the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if the user needs any other details. They just asked for information and population, so sticking to the main points should be sufficient. But adding a bit more context, like the historical significance, might make it more interesting.\n",
