    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Alright, I need to figure out how to get both the current date and time in New York and the weather there. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, for the date and time, I remember there's a function called `get_current_date`. It requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone. So, the function call would be `<function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>`. That should give me the current date and time in New York.<br><br>Next, for the weather. The user is asking about New York, so I'll use the `get_current_weather` function. This function needs a city, state, and unit. I know New York's state is NY, and they want the temperature in Fahrenheit. So, the parameters would be 'city': 'New York', 'state': 'NY', and 'unit': 'fahrenheit'. Putting that together, the function call is `<function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function>`.<br><br>I should call these functions one after the other because they are separate requests. First, get the date and time, then the weather. That way, the user gets both pieces of information without any issues.<br><br>I also need to remember to format my responses correctly, using the specified tags and JSON structure. No markdown, just plain text. Also, I should make sure to include the sources where I got the function descriptions from, which in this case is the provided API documentation.<br><br>So, putting it all together, I'll first reply with the date and time function call, then separately reply with the weather function call.

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out the information and population of the capital of France. The capital is Paris, right? I\\'m going to start by recalling what I know about Paris. From what I remember, Paris is a major city in France and it\\'s also the political and cultural heart of the country.\\n\\nAlright, now I need to get the population figure. I think it\\'s a big city, so the population must be in the millions. I vaguely remember reading that Paris has over 3 million people. But wait, let me make sure I\\'m not confusing it with the metropolitan area. Sometimes, people might refer to the broader area as Paris, which can include outer suburbs. I should check that.\\n\\nWait, actually, I think the metropolitan area of Paris is larger than just the city limits. It might include a couple of million more people. But the question specifically asks for the capital\\'s population, not the metropolitan area. So I\\'ll stick with the city proper population.\\n\\nI think the population is approximately 3.5 million. That seems to ring a bell. To be precise, maybe it\\'s around 3,500,000. I\\'ll go with that number. Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user said to put it in a JSON format, so I\\'ll need to make sure the syntax is correct.\\n\\nLet me outline what the JSON should include. It should have a key-value pairs. Maybe a key like \"capital\" with the name \"Paris\" and another key like \"population\" with the number 3500000. Let me make sure to use the correct syntax, with quotes and commas in the right places.\\n\\nI should also mention that the population figure is approximate because I don\\'t have the exact number at the moment. It\\'s better to note that it may vary slightly. So in the JSON, I can include a note about that.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll write a JSON object with the key \"capital\" set to \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" set to \"3500000\". I\\'ll also add a comment indicating that the population number is approximate.\\n\\nLet me do a quick check to make sure there are no syntax errors. JSON requires that keys are in double quotes, string values are also in double quotes, and that each key is separated by a comma. Also, the entire structure should be properly formatted, maybe with indentation for readability, but since the user didn\\'t specify, I\\'ll keep it simple without indentation.\\n\\nSo, wrapping it up, the JSON should look something like this:\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"note\": \"Population figure is approximate\"\\n}\\n\\nI think that covers everything the user asked for. They wanted the information and population in JSON, so this should fulfill that requirement.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000,\\n  \"note\": \"Population figure is approximate\"\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 576, 6722, 374, 12095, 11, 1290, 30, 358, 2776, 2087, 311, 1191, 553, 88646, 1128, 358, 1414, 911, 12095, 13, 5542, 1128, 358, 6099, 11, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 304, 9625, 323, 432, 594, 1083, 279, 4948, 323, 12752, 4746, 315, 279, 3146, 382, 71486, 11, 1431, 358, 1184, 311, 633, 279, 7042, 7071, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 264, 2409, 3283, 11, 773, 279, 7042, 1969, 387, 304, 279, 11728, 13, 358, 71959, 6099, 5290, 429, 12095, 702, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 1251, 13, 1988, 3783, 11, 1077, 752, 1281, 2704, 358, 2776, 537, 30615, 432, 448, 279, 57406, 3082, 13, 17688, 11, 1251, 2578, 8300, 311, 279, 26829, 3082, 438, 12095, 11, 892, 646, 2924, 15955, 46913, 13, 358, 1265, 1779, 429, 382, 14190, 11, 3520, 11, 358, 1744, 279, 57406, 3082, 315, 12095, 374, 8131, 1091, 1101, 279, 3283, 13388, 13, 1084, 2578, 2924, 264, 5625, 315, 3526, 803, 1251, 13, 1988, 279, 3405, 11689, 17064, 369, 279, 6722, 594, 7042, 11, 537, 279, 57406, 3082, 13, 2055, 358, 3278, 9214, 448, 279, 3283, 6169, 7042, 382, 40, 1744, 279, 7042, 374, 13187, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 13, 2938, 4977, 311, 10058, 264, 28419, 13, 2014, 387, 23560, 11, 7196, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 13, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 429, 1372, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 1053, 311, 2182, 432, 304, 264, 4718, 3561, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1184, 311, 1281, 2704, 279, 19482, 374, 4396, 382, 10061, 752, 21101, 1128, 279, 4718, 1265, 2924, 13, 1084, 1265, 614, 264, 1376, 19083, 13530, 13, 10696, 264, 1376, 1075, 330, 65063, 1, 448, 279, 829, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 2441, 1376, 1075, 330, 44441, 1, 448, 279, 1372, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 13, 6771, 752, 1281, 2704, 311, 990, 279, 4396, 19482, 11, 448, 17194, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 6286, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 374, 44868, 1576, 358, 1513, 944, 614, 279, 4734, 1372, 518, 279, 4445, 13, 1084, 594, 2664, 311, 5185, 429, 432, 1231, 13289, 10078, 13, 2055, 304, 279, 4718, 11, 358, 646, 2924, 264, 5185, 911, 429, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3270, 264, 4718, 1633, 448, 279, 1376, 330, 65063, 1, 738, 311, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 2441, 1376, 330, 44441, 1, 738, 311, 330, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 3263, 358, 3278, 1083, 912, 264, 3980, 18860, 429, 279, 7042, 1372, 374, 44868, 382, 10061, 752, 653, 264, 3974, 1779, 311, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 19482, 5975, 13, 4718, 7460, 429, 6894, 525, 304, 1990, 17194, 11, 914, 2750, 525, 1083, 304, 1990, 17194, 11, 323, 429, 1817, 1376, 374, 18663, 553, 264, 31683, 13, 7281, 11, 279, 4453, 5944, 1265, 387, 10277, 23126, 11, 7196, 448, 69592, 369, 91494, 11, 714, 2474, 279, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 11, 358, 3278, 2506, 432, 4285, 2041, 69592, 382, 4416, 11, 41195, 432, 705, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 510, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 220, 330, 9974, 788, 330, 53371, 7071, 374, 44868, 698, 630, 40, 1744, 429, 14521, 4297, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 13, 2379, 4829, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 20423, 429, 16287, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 220, 330, 9974, 788, 330, 53371, 7071, 374, 44868, 698, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'b021566de18f44428928c94826c4d68e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 632, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.144583463668823}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Alright, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, I know that the capital of France is Paris. But wait, I should double-check that to be sure. Let me think, yes, Paris is indeed the capital. Now, for the population, I remember it's a big city, but the exact number is something I might not know off the top of my head. I think it's around 3 million, but I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should look it up or recall if I've heard that figure before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think in recent years, the population has been growing because of new developments and expats moving there. So perhaps it's a bit higher now. Maybe 3.5 million? Or could it be 2.5 million? I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall if I've heard any news about Paris's population. Oh right, I believe it's over 3 million. Maybe around 3.5 million by now. I'll go with that for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the user wants the information in JSON format. JSON is a data format that's easy to read and write for humans and machines. I should structure it with a \"name\" key for the city, a \"population\" key, and maybe include other details like the region it's in. Since they asked for information and population, I'll include a few more fields for completeness. Maybe the region is Île-de-France, as Paris is part of that. Also, Paris has a metropolitan area that's even bigger, so I should mention that too.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets in the right places. Let me outline the structure first: a main object with keys like \"city\", \"region\", \"population\", and \"metropolitan_area\". Then, under each, add the necessary details. I'll also include the country, which is France, for context.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include the current year as of 2023? That might be useful for the user to know the latest data. Also, is the population figure exact or an estimate? I think it's an approximate number, so I should note that in the JSON as well. Maybe under a \"note\" key to explain that it's an estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the city, population, metropolitan area details, region, country, and a note about the population being an estimate. That should cover everything the user asked for. I should also make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper quotation marks and commas to avoid any errors when they use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's all. Let me write out the JSON structure accordingly and make sure it's correctly formatted. Double-checking the numbers and ensuring that the information flows logically from one key to another. Yeah, that should do it. I can't recall the exact population off the top of my head, but providing an approximate figure with a note is better than being incorrect.\n",
