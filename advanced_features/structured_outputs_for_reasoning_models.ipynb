    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '8c238377dd3747a581a56224d9e2b593', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 3.463141679763794}}\n"

I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

Hmm, the capital of France is Paris, right? Let me think if there\\'s anything else I need to consider. \\n\\nFirst, I should make sure that the JSON structure is correct. They probably need it in a format that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll go with a simple object structure. I should include the city\\'s name, country, and population. Wait, they might not just want the population figure; maybe they want a written number as well. \\n\\nI should look up the latest population numbers for Paris. I know it\\'s around 2 million, but let me confirm the exact figure. According to recent data, Paris has a population of approximately 2,154,309 as of 2022. That seems about right, but I should double-check just to be sure. \\n\\nDo they want any other information besides the population? Maybe a bit more context about Paris would be helpful. Since it\\'s the capital, mentioning the administrative region, along with the region code, could be useful. Oh, and maybe the area in square kilometers? That gives a sense of the city\\'s size. \\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with \"city\": \"Paris\", \"country\": \"France\", \"population\": 2154309, \"factoid\": \"The capital of France, Paris, has a population of approximately 2,154,309 people.\", and \"region\": { \"kod\": \" Île-de-France\", \"naam\": \" Île-de-France\" }. That should cover their request comprehensively. \\n\\nI also need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct—proper commas, quotation marks, and indentation for readability. The user likely wants this for easy parsing or presentation, so clarity is important. \\n\\nAlright, I think that\\'s everything. Just need to present it neatly so they can easily extract the information they need.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"population\": 2154309,\\n  \"factoid\": \"The capital of France, Paris, has a population of approximately 2,154,309 people.\",\\n  \"region\": {\\n    \"kod\": \"Île-de-France\",\\n    \"naam\": \"Île-de-France\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 4588, 752, 311, 3410, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 11, 1290, 30, 6771, 752, 1744, 421, 1052, 594, 4113, 770, 358, 1184, 311, 2908, 13, 4710, 5338, 11, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 429, 279, 4718, 5944, 374, 4396, 13, 2379, 4658, 1184, 432, 304, 264, 3561, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 264, 4285, 1633, 5944, 13, 358, 1265, 2924, 279, 3283, 594, 829, 11, 3146, 11, 323, 7042, 13, 13824, 11, 807, 2578, 537, 1101, 1366, 279, 7042, 7071, 26, 7196, 807, 1366, 264, 5326, 1372, 438, 1632, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1401, 705, 279, 5535, 7042, 5109, 369, 12095, 13, 358, 1414, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 1077, 752, 7683, 279, 4734, 7071, 13, 10548, 311, 3213, 821, 11, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 315, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 16, 20, 19, 11, 18, 15, 24, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 17, 13, 2938, 4977, 911, 1290, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 1101, 311, 387, 2704, 13, 4710, 5404, 807, 1366, 894, 1008, 1995, 27758, 279, 7042, 30, 10696, 264, 2699, 803, 2266, 911, 12095, 1035, 387, 10950, 13, 8704, 432, 594, 279, 6722, 11, 44291, 279, 22707, 5537, 11, 3156, 448, 279, 5537, 2038, 11, 1410, 387, 5390, 13, 8670, 11, 323, 7196, 279, 3082, 304, 9334, 40568, 30, 2938, 6696, 264, 5530, 315, 279, 3283, 594, 1379, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 5944, 279, 4718, 448, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 19, 18, 15, 24, 11, 330, 33110, 588, 788, 330, 785, 6722, 315, 9625, 11, 12095, 11, 702, 264, 7042, 315, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 16, 20, 19, 11, 18, 15, 24, 1251, 10465, 323, 330, 3943, 788, 314, 330, 74, 347, 788, 330, 59108, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 497, 330, 3376, 309, 788, 330, 59108, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 1, 16908, 2938, 1265, 3421, 862, 1681, 12674, 26916, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 19482, 374, 4396, 2293, 80668, 76602, 11, 54231, 15423, 11, 323, 69592, 369, 91494, 13, 576, 1196, 4363, 6801, 419, 369, 4135, 22314, 476, 15496, 11, 773, 31273, 374, 2989, 13, 4710, 71486, 11, 358, 1744, 429, 594, 4297, 13, 4599, 1184, 311, 3042, 432, 62166, 773, 807, 646, 6707, 8649, 279, 1995, 807, 1184, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 19, 18, 15, 24, 345, 220, 330, 33110, 588, 788, 330, 785, 6722, 315, 9625, 11, 12095, 11, 702, 264, 7042, 315, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 16, 20, 19, 11, 18, 15, 24, 1251, 10346, 220, 330, 3943, 788, 341, 262, 330, 74, 347, 788, 330, 71807, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 756, 262, 330, 3376, 309, 788, 330, 71807, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 698, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'acd1ef6060c642a29f2d763f612ac1ba', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 530, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.3521769046783447}}</strong>"

      "\n",
      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out the population of the capital of France and present it in JSON format. Let me start by recalling what the capital of France is. I think it's Paris. Yeah, that's right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to find out the population of Paris. I'm not exactly sure of the exact number, but I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population. I think it's somewhere around 2 million. Wait, no, that seems too low. I think it's more than that. Maybe 2.1 million? Or was it 2.2? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should probably double-check that. I can think of other cities in France and their populations to get a sense. For example, Lyon has around 500,000, Nancy is about 300,000, and Lille is around 400,000. So Paris should definitely be larger than that. Maybe around 2.1 to 2.2 million? I think I've heard that the population is about 2.13 million. So I'll go with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but sometimes populations can vary based on the year and sources. I should make sure I'm using the most recent data. Let me think, is 2021 the latest available? I think it's around that time. So, the population of Paris is approximately 2,130,000 people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to present this information in JSON format. JSON is a data format that's structured with key-value pairs. So, I'll need to create a JSON object that includes the necessary information. Maybe I should include the city name, the country, and the population. That way, it's clear and organized.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it together, the JSON structure would have a key for \"city\" with the value \"Paris,\" a key for \"country\" with the value \"France,\" and a key for \"population\" with the value 2130000. That seems logical.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the syntax is correct. In JSON, the keys are in double quotes, and the values are also in double quotes. The numbers don't need quotes. So, it would look something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"city\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"country\": \"France\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 2130000\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's correct. I should also mention that this population figure is an estimate and might vary slightly depending on the source or the year. Maybe I can add a note like that in parentheses to clarify.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, do I need to include units? Probably not necessary in the JSON itself, but it's good to be clear in the text. So, I can write the population as 2,130,000 people or just 2130000. I think the former is more descriptive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the area of Paris? No, the user only asked for the population, so that's not needed. Also, I should ensure that the JSON is properly formatted, with commas separating the key-value pairs and no trailing commas.\n",
