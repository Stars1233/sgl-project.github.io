    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear.

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'ed22acfb8dd547bea4fcf3b3523250a5', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.1509323120117188}}</strong>"

I know that the capital is Paris, so first thing I need to confirm is its population. I remember hearing that Paris is the most populous city in France, but I\\'m not exactly sure about the exact figure. I think it\\'s around 2 million, maybe 2.18? I\\'ll go with that for now, rounding to keep it simple.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information in JSON. I remember JSON uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" key and a \"population\" key. The name will be \"Paris\" and the population will be the number I just thought of.\\n\\nWait, should I include the unit of population? Probably not necessary for the user, as they just want the raw number. So I\\'ll just put 2180000 in the JSON without adding \\'people\\' or \\'thousand.\\' It\\'s straightforward that way.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct—using quotes around strings, commas in the right places. Double-checking the braces and brackets to ensure there are no errors. Once I have it all together, I\\'ll present it to the user.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2180000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 374, 12095, 11, 773, 1156, 3166, 358, 1184, 311, 7683, 374, 1181, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 10778, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 1429, 94451, 3283, 304, 9625, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 911, 279, 4734, 7071, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 7196, 220, 17, 13, 16, 23, 30, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 429, 369, 1431, 11, 51562, 311, 2506, 432, 4285, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 304, 4718, 13, 358, 6099, 4718, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 1376, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 1376, 13, 576, 829, 686, 387, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 279, 7042, 686, 387, 279, 1372, 358, 1101, 3381, 315, 382, 14190, 11, 1265, 358, 2924, 279, 4982, 315, 7042, 30, 37154, 537, 5871, 369, 279, 1196, 11, 438, 807, 1101, 1366, 279, 7112, 1372, 13, 2055, 358, 3278, 1101, 2182, 220, 17, 16, 23, 15, 15, 15, 15, 304, 279, 4718, 2041, 7842, 364, 16069, 6, 476, 364, 339, 51849, 3159, 1084, 594, 30339, 429, 1616, 382, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 19482, 374, 4396, 2293, 970, 17194, 2163, 9069, 11, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 7093, 15934, 287, 279, 59191, 323, 38929, 311, 5978, 1052, 525, 902, 5975, 13, 9646, 358, 614, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 432, 311, 279, 1196, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 23, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '0fc80a9877644e2bb621898f0c5d6365', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 285, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 1.8572945594787598}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, I just received a query from a user asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the user is really asking for. They specifically mentioned the capital of France, which is Paris, so the main focus is on Paris's population and other related information.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should consider the user's intent. They might be looking for a quick data point, perhaps for a project, a report, or maybe just personal knowledge. Knowing that they want this in JSON format suggests they might be integrating this data into another application or using it programmatically. So, the data needs to be structured properly for that purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to recall the most recent data on Paris's population. From what I remember, as of the latest estimates, Paris has a population of around 2.1 million. However, population numbers can fluctuate due to various factors like births, deaths, and migrations. It's important to check the most recent data to provide accurate information. I think the 2021 estimate was approximately 2,155,000, so I should use that number to be precise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, what other information should I include? The user mentioned \"information,\" so I should provide a comprehensive overview. That means giving a description of Paris, its population figure, and perhaps some context, like when the population was last updated. Including this adds depth and makes the response more useful, especially if the user is relying on this data for analysis or comparison with other cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should structure this information neatly in a JSON format. JSON is key-value pairs, so each piece of information will be an object with a relevant key. For example, \"name\" for the city name, \"population\" for the number, \"description\" for a brief overview, and \"last_updated\" to indicate when the data was current. This structure makes it easy to parse and extract specific information if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also need to ensure the JSON is correctly formatted so there are no syntax errors. Missing commas or incorrect braces can cause issues when the JSON is used in applications. So, I'll double-check the syntax to make sure everything is properly enclosed and separated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the user's potential deeper needs, they might want this data to be easily accessible or comparable with other cities. By providing a structured JSON, it becomes straightforward to integrate into databases or spreadsheets. Additionally, giving a brief description helps in understanding the significance of the population figure without having to look it up elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about the reliability of the source. Population data can be tricky because different sources might have slightly different estimates. However, official sources like the National Institute of Statistics and Research (Insee) in France are reliable, so citing that as the source adds credibility to the information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's easy to read. Using proper indentation and formatting will make it more visually appealing and user-friendly. This way, the user gets exactly what they asked for, presented in a way that's both accurate and useful for their intended purpose.\n",
