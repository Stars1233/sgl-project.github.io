    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out how to get both the current date and time in New York and the weather there using the functions provided. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I know I need to get the current date and time for New York's timezone. The function for that is get_current_date, which requires a timezone parameter. The timezone for New York is usually 'America/New_York'. So I'll call get_current_date with that timezone.<br><br>Next, I need the weather information for the same location. The function get_current_weather takes city, state, and unit as parameters. New York's city is 'New York', the state abbreviation is 'NY', and I should probably get the temperature in Fahrenheit since that's a common unit people use. So I'll use get_current_weather with these parameters.<br><br>I have to make sure to structure the function calls correctly. Each function call should be on its own line, following the specified format. I'll start with get_current_date, then move on to get_current_weather, providing the necessary parameters each time.<br><br>I should also remember to include the source links in the responses whenever I use a function. That way, the user knows where the information is coming from. For example, when I use get_current_date, I'll link to the documentation, and similarly for get_current_weather.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll send two separate function calls: one for the date and time and another for the weather, each with their respective parameters. This should give the user the information they're asking for without any confusion.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\":\"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\":\"New York\", \"state\":\"NY\", \"unit\":\"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '4cffed47708140699034299d9c9d2aba', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.4372589588165283}}</strong>"

First, I need to identify who the user is and what they need. They might not be a native English speaker, so the JSON structure might be a bit different, but I should know that JSON is the standard between systems, so it\\'s fine.\\n\\nI think the user probably needs this information for a report, a project, or maybe just general knowledge. They might not have easy access to a reliable source, so they\\'re turning to me for help. The fact that they\\'re asking for JSON suggests they might be integrating this data into an application or database, which means accuracy is crucial.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON is well-formatted and includes all necessary fields: capital name, population, year of population data, and an interesting fact. Also, it\\'s good to provide the population as an estimate since exact numbers can vary by source and year. Maybe 2021 is a recent enough figure that\\'s commonly used.\\n\\nI should double-check the population figure to ensure it\\'s up to date. If I\\'m unsure, I might need to mention that the data is from a reliable source like the World Bank. Also, the interesting fact adds context, so I\\'ll include something notable about Paris, like it being the largest city in the EU.\\n\\nOverall, keeping the response clear and concise is key, but including all the necessary details will help the user integrate the data effectively into whatever system they\\'re using.

But wait, I should double-check that to make sure it's accurate. Maybe I can recall recent estimates or any recent reports that might have updated the numbers. \n",

I'll include keys like \"city\", \"population\", \"area\", and maybe \"founded\" if relevant. Wait, Paris is the capital and the largest city, so including \"area\" makes sense to provide a bit more context.\n",

      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with an \"info\" key containing the city name and the data. The population should be an integer, and the area a float. I'll make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets in the right places to avoid any syntax errors.\n",
