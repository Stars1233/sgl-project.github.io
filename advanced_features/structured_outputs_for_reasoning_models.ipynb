    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '7250593a300843039ab8c9fe1f068b74', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3506102561950684}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, I need to help the user get the information about the capital of France, which is Paris, and provide it in JSON format. Let me start by recalling some basic details about Paris. I know that Paris is the largest city in France and the capital. It\\'s also one of the most important cities globally because it\\'s the seat of government for many important organizations like the EU and the UN. I should include that detail.\\n\\nNext, I think about Paris\\'s population. As of the last updates, it\\'s over 2 million residents. I remember seeing it mentioned that the population is approximately 2,100,000, but I should make sure this figure is up to date and accurate. Maybe I should check a recent source to confirm. I believe the population growth has been steady, especially with a influx of international students and workers contributing to its diverse demographics.\\n\\nAdditionally, Paris is known for its rich history, cultural landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, and its status as a global hub for arts and entertainment. Including these points would add depth to the information, making it more informative for the user. \\n\\nSo, structuring the JSON, I should have a key for \"city_name\" with \"Paris\" as the value. Another key could be \"population\", which I\\'ll set to 2125000, as of the latest data. Adding more details under the \"population\" key would help categorize the information, such as current population, historical population, and growth rate. This way, the user gets a comprehensive view of the population aspects.\\n\\nI also want to highlight Paris\\'s significance in international contexts since that\\'s a key factor in it being the capital.

That's pretty straightforward. Now, I need to figure out what information they're looking for. They mentioned population, so I'll definitely need the current population number. But maybe they also want some additional details about the city or the region. I should think about what's commonly included in such data.\n",

      "I remember that Paris is a major city with a rich history and cultural significance. It's not just about the population; there's also the area, maybe the languages spoken there, or perhaps some notable landmarks. Wait, the user specifically asked for population, so maybe sticking to that is better unless I can infer more details. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should check the latest population figures for Paris. I think the population is around 2 million people. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the most recent number. Maybe I should double-check that. Also, Paris is divided into several arrondissements, so perhaps the population figure refers to the entire city, not just the administrative center. \n",

I don't want to include unnecessary information unless the user asks for it. Since they only mentioned population, I'll stick to that. \n",

Also, considering factors like urbanization, migration, and natural growth, the population might have increased or decreased slightly. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to overcomplicate the JSON. It should be clean and concise. So, the JSON will have \"name\", \"country\", and \"population\". I'll make sure the population number is accurate. If I'm unsure, perhaps I can mention that the population figure is approximate or based on recent data. \n",
