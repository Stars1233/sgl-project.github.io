    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The function requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'c6fb07f507564869a915019f482137c1', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.0898122787475586}}</strong>"

Let me break this down step by step to make sure I get everything correct.\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the basic facts about Paris. I know that Paris is indeed the capital city of France, so that\\'s a given. Now, I should probably look up the most recent population numbers, but since I can\\'t access the internet right now, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. I remember that the population has been growing steadily over the years.\\n\\nI think the current population is somewhere around 2 million, but that might be a bit outdated. I recall reading somewhere that Paris has one of the largest populations in Europe. Maybe it\\'s over two million now, perhaps even three million. I should double-check that number in my memory. I think the exact figure is 2,177,121 as of 2023. That sounds about right.\\n\\nIn addition to the population, I should include some notable landmarks or features of Paris to make the information more comprehensive. For example, the Eiffel Tower is a famous landmark and a symbol of the city. It was one of the primary reasons why Paris became the capital, as Napoleon Bonaparte needed a place to gather his troops, and the Eiffel Tower was already famous for its height.\\n\\nAnother important aspect is the political center. Along with the Eiffel Tower, the Château de Versailles on the right bank of the Seine is a significant political and historic building. It\\'s a prominent sight that many people recognize when visiting Paris.\\n\\nI should structure the JSON with these key points: the name of the city, its population, the Eiffel Tower, and the Château de Versailles. Make sure to include all the relevant information clearly and concisely.\\n\\nWait, but I should be careful with the population numbers. I might be mixing up the data from different sources or time periods. If I\\'m not sure, perhaps I should assume a reasonable estimate for the population. But since I have a specific number in mind, 2,177,121, I\\'ll use that and mention it\\'s as of 2023.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have an \"info\" field with the city name and population, and an \"examples\" field with the landmarks. This structure seems logical and easy to understand.\\n\\nI should also make sure that the JSON syntax is correct. The keys should be strings in quotes, and the values should be numbers or other strings. For the population, I can present it as a number without quotes. The landmarks can be in either format, but perhaps text for clarity.\\n\\nSo, summarizing the steps:\\n1. Identify the capital of France.\\n2. Find the current population.\\n3. Note the Eiffel Tower as a landmark.\\n4. Note the Château de Versailles as another landmark.\\n5. Structure this information in a JSON object.\\n\\nLet me draft the JSON now. The \"info\" key will have a \"city\" string and a \"population\" number. The \"examples\" key will be an array containing the two strings for the landmarks.\\n\\nTo double-check, I think the Eiffel Tower was built around 1889, so that\\'s visible and iconic. The Château de Versailles, on the other hand, was built later, around 1775, but it\\'s still a prominent feature in Paris. Both are crucial to Paris\\'s identity and history.\\n\\nI don\\'t see any immediate red flags in this information. It\\'s straightforward and covers the necessary points without unnecessary details. This should serve the purpose well for the user who is asking for this information.\\n\\nOne last thing is to ensure that the JSON uses proper formatting, with commas separating the key-value pairs and proper braces. Since the user will be reading this, it should be correctly indented and each key-value pair separated by a comma, except where necessary.\\n\\nAlright, I think I\\'ve covered all the bases here. Paris is the capital, has a population of about two million, and is famous for the Eiffel Tower and Château de Versailles. The JSON structure properly organizes this information in a clear and concise manner.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Answer:**\\n\\nHere is the JSON information about Paris, the capital of France, including its population and notable landmarks:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"info\": {\\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2177121\\n  },\\n  \"examples\": [\\n    \"Eiffel Tower\",\\n    \"Château de Versailles\"\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON structure provides a clear and concise overview of Paris\\'s status as the capital, its population, and two of its iconic landmarks.', 'output_ids': [13,
