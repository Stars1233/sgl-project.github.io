    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations.

Let me start by recalling the functions available. There's 'get_current_weather' and 'get_current_date'. <br><br>First, I should probably get the current date and time because that seems straightforward. I remember that the 'get_current_date' function requires a timezone parameter. New York is in the 'America/New_York' timezone, so I need to make sure I use that. <br><br>Now, for the weather, I need the city and state. New York is in NY state. So I'll use 'get_current_weather' with 'city' as 'New York' and 'state' as 'NY'. It also needs the unit, so I'll choose 'fahrenheit' since that's what I'm more familiar with, but maybe the user prefers Celsius. I'll include both options just in case.<br><br>Wait, but I should call one function at a time. Maybe I'll first get the current date and time. I'll structure the function call as <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>.

That way, I get both temperature units.<br><br>Putting it all together, I should first get the date and time, then the weather with both units. But maybe it's better to do them separately to avoid confusion. Let me make sure I'm using the correct syntax for the parameters. Each function call should be on a single line with the function name and parameters in JSON format.<br><br>I think that's it.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, I just got a query from a user. They asked me to provide the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out what exactly the user is asking for. They want the capital of France, so that\\'s straightforward – it\\'s Paris. But they also specifically mentioned the population, so I have to make sure I include that number.\\n\\nNow, I need to structure this in JSON. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll probably have a main key like \"capital\" with an object containing the city name and population. That makes the information clear and easy to parse if someone else is using the JSON.\\n\\nWait, the user included an example in their initial message. They provided:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2_167_107.2\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nI should follow that example to maintain consistency. Using underscores in numbers is a good practice, so the population number looks clean and professional.\\n\\nI wonder why the user is asking for this. Maybe they\\'re working on a project, a school assignment, or perhaps they\\'re developing an app that requires population data. Either way, being precise is key. I\\'ll need to make sure the population number is accurate. I know the population of Paris is a constantly changing figure, so I\\'ll look up the most recent estimate. I believe around February 2024, Paris had about 2.167 million people. Since it\\'s a large city, sometimes estimates are rounded, but I\\'ll use the exact figure if I can find it.\\n\\nI should also consider if there are any rounding issues. In JSON, using a float is okay, but sometimes integers are cleaner. However, the population can vary based on the year, so a float might be more accurate. Alternatively, maybe the user expects it as an integer. But since the example uses a float, I\\'ll stick with that for consistency.\\n\\nAnother thing to think about is the format of the population number. Should it be 2_167_107.2 or perhaps expressed as 2,167,107.2? Either way, the underscores help readability, so I\\'ll follow that.\\n\\nOnce I structure the JSON, I\\'ll double-check to ensure there are no typos or formatting errors. It\\'s important that the JSON is valid because many tools and platforms require correctly formatted JSON to work without errors. \\n\\nI also need to present this information clearly to the user. They might just copy-paste it into their project or use it somewhere else, so it\\'s good to be concise yet informative.\\n\\nIs there a chance that the user might need more details?
