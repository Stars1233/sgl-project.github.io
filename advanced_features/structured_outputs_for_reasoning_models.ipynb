    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s straightforward, but I should double-check to make sure I\\'m correct. Paris is indeed the official capital, though some smaller towns might sometimes host the presidential elections. But for population purposes, it\\'s definitely the main city.\\n\\nNow, the user wants the population data. I\\'m not sure of the latest exact figure, but I remember it\\'s around 2 million. However, populations can change every year, so I should be careful. I\\'ll need to provide an approximate number, but also note that it can vary.\\n\\nWait, should I include a source for the information? The user didn\\'t specify any particular format beyond JSON, so maybe it\\'s better to present it clearly without extra details. Including a caution about population changes would be helpful though.\\n\\nThe user specified JSON format, so I need to structure the response with keys for population and capital. Maybe something like \"capital\" as a string and \"population\" as a number. Here\\'s how that would look:\\n\\n{\\n  \"population\": 2154000,\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\"\\n}\\n\\nI should make sure to mention that the population might have changed since the last update. I don\\'t want to give incorrect or outdated information. Maybe I should also present the approximate figure and note the range, just to be thorough.\\n\\nWait, I think the current population is around 2.15 million, so I\\'ll write that. Also, adding something like \"(approximate as of recent records)\" would clarify that it\\'s not the most up-to-date number.\\n\\nLet me structure this again.

      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's a given. Now, I need to find the current population. I remember that Paris is a very populous city, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact number. I think it's somewhere around 2 million, but I could be wrong. Maybe I should double-check that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user specified the population. I should make sure it's accurate. I recall that the population numbers can vary slightly depending on the source and the time of the year. For example, during certain times of the year, people might be visiting, which could affect the count. But for the sake of this, I think the most commonly cited number is approximately 2.1 million. That seems right.\n",

      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. So, I need to structure this information into a JSON object.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should include the key-value pairs: the capital name as the key and its population as the value. Maybe I can also include the country it's in, which is France, for context. That would make the JSON more informative and useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON structure would have a key like \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\", another key \"population\" with the number 2100000, and perhaps a \"country\" key with \"France\". This way, the user gets a clear and organized piece of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure the numbers are accurate and up-to-date. Since I'm not a real-time data source, I should note that the population figure might change slightly over time. But for now, 2.1 million is a solid figure.\n",
