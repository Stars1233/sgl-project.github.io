    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",

    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, I need to figure out how to respond to the user\\'s query about the capital of France. They asked for the information and population of the capital in JSON format. \\n\\nFirst, I know the capital city is Paris. That part is straightforward. But I should double-check to make sure I\\'m correct because sometimes capitals can change, though I don\\'t think it\\'s the case for France. Paris has been the capital for a long time now.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the most recent population data for Paris. Population numbers can change yearly, so I\\'ll look for the latest available figure, probably from 2023 since that\\'s the most up-to-date data I can access. I remember that major cities in France tend to have populations in the hundreds of thousands, so I expect Paris\\'s population is around that range.\\n\\nI should structure this information into a JSON format. JSON is a data interchange format, and for this response, I\\'ll need an object with the capital name and a nested object containing population, including the year and an approximate number. This way, the user gets clear and concise information that\\'s easy to parse.\\n\\nAlso, I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. I\\'ll need proper use of colons, quotation marks, and commas to avoid any errors. Maybe I can write the JSON here so it\\'s clear.\\n\\nI wonder if the user is a student working on a project or maybe someone doing research. Knowing the population is important for demographics studies or urban planning. Maybe they want this data for a presentation or a paper. Providing an approximate figure along with the year helps them understand the trend over time.\\n\\nI should also consider if there are any other enhancements they might need, like current data from recent years or more detailed statistics, but the main request was for the JSON with population, so sticking to that makes sense.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a neat format, perhaps in a code block, so it\\'s easy to read and copy. Making sure the response is helpful and meets their requirements is key.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": {\\n      \"value\": 2189000,\\n      \"year\": 2023\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object contains the following information:\\n- The name of the capital city, \"Paris\".\\n- The population value of approximately 2,189,000 in the year 2023.', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 5889, 311, 279, 1196, 594, 3239, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 2379, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 4710, 5338, 11, 358, 1414, 279, 6722, 3283, 374, 12095, 13, 2938, 949, 374, 30339, 13, 1988, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 311, 1281, 2704, 358, 2776, 4396, 1576, 7025, 92999, 646, 2297, 11, 3498, 358, 1513, 944, 1744, 432, 594, 279, 1142, 369, 9625, 13, 12095, 702, 1012, 279, 6722, 369, 264, 1293, 882, 1431, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 369, 12095, 13, 39529, 5109, 646, 2297, 44270, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1401, 369, 279, 5535, 2500, 7071, 11, 4658, 504, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 2474, 429, 594, 279, 1429, 705, 4686, 18413, 821, 358, 646, 2615, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 3598, 9720, 304, 9625, 8376, 311, 614, 21910, 304, 279, 11499, 315, 9037, 11, 773, 358, 1720, 12095, 594, 7042, 374, 2163, 429, 2088, 382, 40, 1265, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 374, 264, 821, 51263, 3561, 11, 323, 369, 419, 2033, 11, 358, 3278, 1184, 458, 1633, 448, 279, 6722, 829, 323, 264, 24034, 1633, 8482, 7042, 11, 2670, 279, 1042, 323, 458, 44868, 1372, 13, 1096, 1616, 11, 279, 1196, 5221, 2797, 323, 63594, 1995, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 4715, 382, 13394, 11, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 19482, 374, 4396, 13, 358, 3278, 1184, 6169, 990, 315, 1375, 2382, 11, 54231, 15423, 11, 323, 76602, 311, 5648, 894, 5975, 13, 10696, 358, 646, 3270, 279, 4718, 1588, 773, 432, 594, 2797, 382, 40, 5775, 421, 279, 1196, 374, 264, 5458, 3238, 389, 264, 2390, 476, 7196, 4325, 3730, 3412, 13, 57633, 279, 7042, 374, 2989, 369, 62234, 7822, 476, 15662, 9115, 13, 10696, 807, 1366, 419, 821, 369, 264, 15496, 476, 264, 5567, 13, 80100, 458, 44868, 7071, 3156, 448, 279, 1042, 8609, 1105, 3535, 279, 9149, 916, 882, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 421, 1052, 525, 894, 1008, 58529, 807, 2578, 1184, 11, 1075, 1482, 821, 504, 3213, 1635, 476, 803, 11682, 13142, 11, 714, 279, 1887, 1681, 572, 369, 279, 4718, 448, 7042, 11, 773, 36972, 311, 429, 3643, 5530, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 28485, 3561, 11, 8365, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 11, 773, 432, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 323, 2975, 13, 24288, 2704, 279, 2033, 374, 10950, 323, 20027, 862, 8502, 374, 1376, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 262, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 341, 414, 330, 957, 788, 220, 17, 16, 23, 24, 15, 15, 15, 345, 414, 330, 3157, 788, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 198, 262, 456, 220, 456, 532, 13874, 19324, 1986, 4718, 1633, 5610, 279, 2701, 1995, 510, 12, 576, 829, 315, 279, 6722, 3283, 11, 330, 59604, 22956, 12, 576, 7042, 897, 315, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 16, 23, 24, 11, 15, 15, 15, 304, 279, 1042, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'effb76496f27467fbae69bfd30db7fe9', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 526, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.301400899887085}}</strong>"
