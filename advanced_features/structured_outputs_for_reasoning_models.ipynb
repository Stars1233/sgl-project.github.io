    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'dbc8892e504549bf8a089720cf11f48c', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.6125380992889404}}</strong>"

I know that Paris is its capital, which makes sense because I\\'ve heard it mentioned a lot in the context of France. \\n\\nNow, about the population. I remember that Paris is the largest city in France, so it must have a large population. But I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. I believe it\\'s in the millions, but I\\'m not certain. I\\'ve heard it\\'s over 3 million, maybe around 3.5 or 3.6 million. \\n\\nI should check if there\\'s any recent data on this. I think population figures can change slightly each year due to births, deaths, and migration. So it\\'s possible the number I remember is a rough estimate. If I were to look it up, I could use sources like official government statistics or recent reports from organizations like the United Nations or World Bank. \\n\\nHowever, since I don\\'t have access to current data right now, I should probably go with the commonly cited figure. So, I\\'ll assume Paris has a population of approximately 3,500,432 as of 2023, even though I\\'m not entirely certain it\\'s still accurate. It\\'s always good to verify sources when providing specific data, especially when it comes to population counts which can fluctuate.\\n\\nAlso, it\\'s worth noting that while Paris is the capital, other major cities in France are growing faster than the capital. Cities like Lille, Lyon, and Marseille have populations in the hundreds of thousands and are expanding, but Paris remains the largest. \\n\\nIn summary, I\\'m confident enough that Paris is the capital with a population of about 3.5 million as of 2023, even if the exact number might vary slightly.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3504327\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 323, 1181, 7042, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 6771, 752, 1191, 553, 88646, 1128, 358, 1414, 911, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 1181, 6722, 11, 892, 3643, 5530, 1576, 358, 3003, 6617, 432, 9733, 264, 2696, 304, 279, 2266, 315, 9625, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 911, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 7772, 3283, 304, 9625, 11, 773, 432, 1969, 614, 264, 3460, 7042, 13, 1988, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 4411, 432, 594, 304, 279, 11728, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 3654, 13, 358, 3003, 6617, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 7196, 2163, 220, 18, 13, 20, 476, 220, 18, 13, 21, 3526, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1779, 421, 1052, 594, 894, 3213, 821, 389, 419, 13, 358, 1744, 7042, 12396, 646, 2297, 10078, 1817, 1042, 4152, 311, 65232, 11, 16375, 11, 323, 11906, 13, 2055, 432, 594, 3204, 279, 1372, 358, 6099, 374, 264, 11165, 16045, 13, 1416, 358, 1033, 311, 1401, 432, 705, 11, 358, 1410, 990, 8173, 1075, 3946, 3033, 13142, 476, 3213, 6682, 504, 11104, 1075, 279, 3639, 19140, 476, 4337, 8547, 13, 4710, 11209, 11, 2474, 358, 1513, 944, 614, 2615, 311, 1482, 821, 1290, 1431, 11, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 16626, 21870, 7071, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 315, 13187, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 19, 18, 17, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 1496, 3498, 358, 2776, 537, 11368, 3654, 432, 594, 2058, 13382, 13, 1084, 594, 2677, 1661, 311, 10146, 8173, 979, 8241, 3151, 821, 11, 5310, 979, 432, 4041, 311, 7042, 14579, 892, 646, 38288, 6292, 382, 13394, 11, 432, 594, 5802, 26305, 429, 1393, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 1008, 3598, 9720, 304, 9625, 525, 7826, 10596, 1091, 279, 6722, 13, 37273, 1075, 444, 4517, 11, 55201, 11, 323, 87693, 614, 21910, 304, 279, 11499, 315, 9037, 323, 525, 23175, 11, 714, 12095, 8458, 279, 7772, 13, 4710, 641, 12126, 11, 358, 2776, 16506, 3322, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 448, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 1496, 421, 279, 4734, 1372, 2578, 13289, 10078, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 19, 18, 17, 22, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '46bc5394446740759784c09be418b08d', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 415, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.637779474258423}}</strong>"
