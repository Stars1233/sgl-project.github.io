    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'd1a41ce2c44b4951a1b00d15c56be8db', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.783523797988892}}</strong>"

I immediately recognized that the capital of France is Paris, which I know for sure.\\n\\nFirst, I considered what information is typically included in such a response. The basic structure usually includes the city name, country name, and population facts. I need to make sure all these elements are clearly and concisely presented in the JSON format.\\n\\nI should start by outlining the keys for the JSON. The main object could be the capital city itself, containing properties like name, country, location, and the main population figures—both current and recent estimates.\\n\\nNext, I looked at the population data. As of 2023, Paris has a metropolitan area population of around 12.57 million and a registered inhabitants count of approximately 12.43 million. These numbers should be up-to-date but might vary slightly depending on the source.\\n\\nI thought about the formatting. The JSON needs to be valid, so each key should be in double quotes, and the string values should also be in double quotes. Proper indentation helps readability, so I decided to format it neatly with each key on a new line for clarity.\\n\\nI also considered whether to include additional details, like the prefecture or a significant nickname, which could add context and make the information more engaging. Paris is well-known for being the \"City of Light,\" so adding that could be interesting for the user.\\n\\nFinally, I structured the JSON by first defining the main capital object and then adding the population statistics. I made sure the entire structure is correctly formatted to avoid any syntax errors. This way, the JSON will validate correctly if used in another application.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"country\": \"France\",\\n    \"location\": \" Île-de-France\",\\n    \"population\": {\\n      \"metropolitan_area\": 12570000,\\n      \"registered_inhabitants\": 12430000,\\n      \"divided_inhabitants\": 3420000\\n    },\\n    \"history\": \"The city is one of the oldest capitals of the Western world, having been a major European metropolis since ancient times.\"\\n    \"main_development\": \"La Défense\",\\n    \"nickname\": \"The City of Light\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 4588, 752, 311, 3410, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 358, 7069, 14975, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 11, 892, 358, 1414, 369, 2704, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 6509, 1128, 1995, 374, 11136, 5230, 304, 1741, 264, 2033, 13, 576, 6770, 5944, 5990, 5646, 279, 3283, 829, 11, 3146, 829, 11, 323, 7042, 13064, 13, 358, 1184, 311, 1281, 2704, 678, 1493, 5424, 525, 9355, 323, 3529, 285, 974, 10449, 304, 279, 4718, 3561, 382, 40, 1265, 1191, 553, 78674, 279, 6894, 369, 279, 4718, 13, 576, 1887, 1633, 1410, 387, 279, 6722, 3283, 5086, 11, 8482, 5888, 1075, 829, 11, 3146, 11, 3728, 11, 323, 279, 1887, 7042, 12396, 2293, 21028, 1482, 323, 3213, 17530, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 6966, 518, 279, 7042, 821, 13, 1634, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 12095, 702, 264, 57406, 3082, 7042, 315, 2163, 220, 16, 17, 13, 20, 22, 3526, 323, 264, 9681, 39671, 1760, 315, 13187, 220, 16, 17, 13, 19, 18, 3526, 13, 4220, 5109, 1265, 387, 705, 4686, 18413, 714, 2578, 13289, 10078, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 382, 40, 3381, 911, 279, 36566, 13, 576, 4718, 3880, 311, 387, 2697, 11, 773, 1817, 1376, 1265, 387, 304, 1990, 17194, 11, 323, 279, 914, 2750, 1265, 1083, 387, 304, 1990, 17194, 13, 64558, 69592, 8609, 91494, 11, 773, 358, 6635, 311, 3561, 432, 62166, 448, 1817, 1376, 389, 264, 501, 1555, 369, 31273, 382, 40, 1083, 6509, 3425, 311, 2924, 5107, 3565, 11, 1075, 279, 89445, 552, 476, 264, 5089, 29399, 11, 892, 1410, 912, 2266, 323, 1281, 279, 1995, 803, 22570, 13, 12095, 374, 1632, 21309, 369, 1660, 279, 330, 12730, 315, 8658, 1335, 773, 7842, 429, 1410, 387, 7040, 369, 279, 1196, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 32930, 279, 4718, 553, 1156, 26312, 279, 1887, 6722, 1633, 323, 1221, 7842, 279, 7042, 13142, 13, 358, 1865, 2704, 279, 4453, 5944, 374, 12440, 23126, 311, 5648, 894, 19482, 5975, 13, 1096, 1616, 11, 279, 4718, 686, 9593, 12440, 421, 1483, 304, 2441, 3766, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 262, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 262, 330, 2527, 788, 330, 59108, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 756, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 341, 414, 330, 4059, 30511, 15030, 788, 220, 16, 17, 20, 22, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 414, 330, 34909, 1243, 96702, 1783, 788, 220, 16, 17, 19, 18, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 414, 330, 611, 4490, 1243, 96702, 1783, 788, 220, 18, 19, 17, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 262, 1153, 262, 330, 18844, 788, 330, 785, 3283, 374, 825, 315, 279, 23513, 92999, 315, 279, 10867, 1879, 11, 3432, 1012, 264, 3598, 7513, 2270, 54322, 2474, 13833, 3039, 10040, 262, 330, 3817, 2259, 75831, 788, 330, 8747, 49401, 69, 1117, 756, 262, 330, 39413, 788, 330, 785, 4311, 315, 8658, 698, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'd9189ac44de940d583206a0c8ac08111', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 516, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.1881537437438965}}</strong>"

      "\n",
      "First, I need to identify the capital of France. I'm pretty sure it's Paris, but just to be sure, maybe I can quickly confirm that. Yes, Paris is indeed the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to find the population. Population numbers can change over time, so I should look for the most recent data. I remember that as of 2023, the population was around 2 million. But to be precise, I should check a reliable source. Maybe the latest census or a recent government publication. Let me think, I believe the population figure is approximately 2,165,000 as of 2022. That's a bit outdated, but it's close enough for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. So I should structure it with keys like \"city\" and \"population\". \n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. The city name should be in quotes, and the population number should be an integer. Also, including the note about the population figure being approximate would be helpful, as it clarifies that the number might not be up to date.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll create a JSON object with the keys \"city\" and \"population\". The city will be \"Paris\", and the population will be \"2165000\". Adding a comment or note that the figure is approximate would make the response more transparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there are any other details the user might need, like the country it's in, but since they specifically asked for the capital, maybe that's sufficient. However, if they need more info, offering to provide additional data could be helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I need to make sure the JSON is properly formatted without any errors, so that when the user uses it, there are no parsing issues. Double-checking the quotes and commas is essential here.\n",
