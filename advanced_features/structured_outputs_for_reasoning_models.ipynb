    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'f4c25bd745124ba5b7f4c16ef7585006', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.2691853046417236}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out the information and population of the capital city of France in JSON format. Alright, let me start by recalling what I know about France. The capital of France is Paris, right? That\\'s the big city in the center that they call \"La Ville Soleil\" or the Sun City. It\\'s where a lot of important things happen, like political centers, the Eiffel Tower is there, and it\\'s a major tourist spot.\\n\\nNow, I need to find out the population of Paris. From what I remember, Paris is the most populous city in France, and usually, its population is around 2 million. But I\\'m not entirely sure if it\\'s exactly 2 million or if it\\'s a bit more. Maybe I should think about recent data. I think it fluctuates a bit, but historically, it\\'s been close to 2 million.\\n\\nWait, Paris is also known as one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world. I think its population surpasses even some bigger countries. But I should verify that. Also, the population figure can change every census or estimate, so it\\'s always good to have the most current data.\\n\\nI recall that the population figure is often cited as around 2.1 million, but I might be mixing it up with another city. Alternatively, maybe it\\'s more accurate to say that Paris had about 2.2 million people in recent years. Hmm, I\\'m getting confused because sometimes I hear it referred to as the metro area, which might include a larger area and thus have a bigger population.\\n\\nOh, right, the population figures for Paris can be tricky because people sometimes refer to the city proper versus its metropolitan area. The city of Paris is different from what people usually think of when they hear Paris. So, if I\\'m talking about the capital\\'s administrative center, that\\'s the city proper, which is around 2.1 million. But the metropolitan area includes suburbs and that number is higher, maybe around 8 million.\\n\\nWait, no, that can\\'t be right because 8 million seems too high for the metropolitan area compared to other major cities in similar countries. Let me think again. Maybe it\\'s more around 7 million for the metropolitan area. But I\\'m not 100% sure.\\n\\nAnother thought: I remember reading that Paris has the highest population density in Europe. So, even though the city area is, say, 12 square kilometers, the population is large because of the high density. So, the population is around 2 million, but I might be off by a few hundred thousand.\\n\\nI also think that Paris is home to a significant number of expatriates and other international communities, which might contribute to its diverse population. But I\\'m focusing on the population of the capital, so it\\'s probably the number of residents in Paris proper.\\n\\nIn terms of exact numbers, I\\'m going to check an authoritative source or maybe a recent census. But since I can\\'t access external info right now, I\\'ll go with my best estimate. So, I\\'ll say the population is approximately 2.2 million, and that\\'s the number for Paris, with the metropolitan area being higher, around 8.5 million.\\n\\nWait, but that seems high for such a city. Maybe the metropolitan area is only up to 6.5 million? I\\'m getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I might have the numbers mixed up, so I should be precise. To avoid confusion, perhaps I should just state the city proper population as about 2.2 million and the metropolitan area as larger, maybe 8.5 million, considering that Paris has a significant suburban population.\\n\\nOkay, putting it all together, the JSON should include the city name, population, and maybe some extra information if needed. But since the user only asked for the capital, I\\'ll stick to that. So, in JSON, it would be something like:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2222222,\\n    \"infobox\": {\\n      \"active\": true,\\n      \"coordinates\": { /* maybe include some coordinates here */ },\\n      \"founding_date\": \"1348 AD\",\\n      \"inhours\": \"Never at night! 🎤\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nBut wait, adding an infobox might be optional unless specified. The user just asked for the population, so perhaps it\\'s better to keep it simple with the city name and the population number. So, the JSON would just have the \\'capital\\' object with \\'name\\' and \\'population\\'.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the capital of France is Paris with a population around 2.2 million, as of recent estimates.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2222222\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe JSON output provides the information about the capital of France, which is Paris. The population figure given is an approximate value based on recent estimates.', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315,
