    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",

    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, let\\'s see. The user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I need to identify what the capital is. I know it\\'s Paris. Now, about the population, I remember it\\'s a big city, but I\\'m not exactly sure about the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should make sure that\\'s the most recent figure. \\n\\nI should verify the data to ensure accuracy. Maybe I can recall from recent news or any reports I\\'ve come across. As of my last update, Paris has a population of about 2.17 million, but it\\'s growing every year. So, approximating it as 2 million makes sense for a general answer.\\n\\nNext, structuring this information in JSON. I need to make a dictionary with appropriate keys. The user mentioned \"information and population,\" so I\\'ll have \"city\" and \"population\" as keys. The population can be an integer, so I\\'ll write it as 2000000.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look neat and be easy to read. I don\\'t need to add extra information unless requested. I should keep it simple and direct, as the user seems to want just the facts without any extra details.\\n\\nI should also double-check for any possible misspellings or formatting issues to make sure the JSON is valid. Using double quotes around the keys and string values, and commas correctly placed is essential for the JSON to parse properly.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON as the answer, making sure it\\'s clear and formatted correctly.
