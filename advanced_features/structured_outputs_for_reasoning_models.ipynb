    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is in New York and wants the current date and time along with the weather. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I need to figure out how to get the current date and time. The user mentioned New York, so I should use the 'get_current_date' function. The parameters required are the timezone, which in this case is 'America/New_York'. I'll structure the function call with that parameter.<br><br>Next, the user also wants the weather. Since they're in New York, I should use the 'get_current_weather' function. The parameters needed here are the city and state. New York's city is 'New York' and the state abbreviation is 'NY'. I'll include both in the function call.<br><br>Now, I have to make sure each function is called correctly. For the date and time, it's straightforward with just the timezone. For the weather, I need both city and state. I'll structure both function calls on separate lines as per the instructions.<br><br>I also need to remember to add the source links for each function call. For 'get_current_date', the source is the official documentation, and similarly for 'get_current_weather'. <br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write two separate function calls: one for the date and time with the timezone parameter, and another for the weather with city and state parameters. Each will have their respective sources linked.<br><br>I should double-check that I'm using the correct parameter names and values. The timezone for New York is correct as 'America/New_York', and the city and state for New York are accurate. <br><br>Finally, I'll ensure the response follows the specified format, with each function call on its own line and the correct start and end tags. This way, the user gets clear, concise answers with the necessary information.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\"  , \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function>  <br><br>Source:  <br>- [get_current_date official documentation](https://docs.example.com/get_current_date)  <br>- [get_current_weather official documentation](https://docs.example.com/get_current_weather)</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'c5b80a10e51448bca96c7b3fed766fc5', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.0011208057403564}}</strong>"

I remember it\\'s a major city with a well-known population. But I need to make sure I have the correct figures.\\n\\nI should check if the population is up to date. I think as of 2023, it\\'s around 2 million, but exact numbers can vary each year. Sometimes, the figures are approximate. I\\'ll note that the population might change slightly depending on the source. \\n\\nNext, I\\'ll structure the JSON. It should be something like {\"city\": \"Paris\", \"country\": \"France\", \"population\": \"2,042,214\"}. I included quotes around the string values because population counts are not typically stored as actual integers. But the user said \"information and population,\" which is a bit unclear. They might mean just the current city and population without the country. However, including the country is standard for such data, so I\\'ll stick with that.\\n\\nI should consider the user\\'s purpose. Are they a student working on a project, a researcher, or someone else? Probably a general user needing a quick data point. They might be using this for a website, a report, or just for information. Including the capital without the country could be acceptable, but it\\'s safer to include both for context.\\n\\nAlso, the user asked for JSON, which is a structured format, so formatting is important. I\\'ll make sure the JSON syntax is correct—proper commas, quotation marks, and braces. \\n\\nIf I were to add more information, like area or nickname, but the user only asked for population and information. They didn\\'t specify, so I\\'ll limit it to city, country, and population.\\n\\nIn summary, the JSON should clearly state Paris as the capital, France, and the population around 2.04 million, with a note about the approximate nature of the figure.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"population\": \"2,042,214\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON includes the city name (`Paris`), the country (`France`), and an approximate population figure (`2,042,214` as of the latest available data).
