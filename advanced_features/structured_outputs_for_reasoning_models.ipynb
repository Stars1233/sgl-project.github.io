    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number.

I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'e6578f423f314d1cbb8443cc3a4a8142', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.562429904937744}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I need to figure out the correct information and population of the capital of France. Okay, first things first, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty straightforward. But I need to make sure I remember that correctly because sometimes capitals can change, though I don\\'t think that\\'s the case here.\\n\\nNow, the population part might be a bit trickier. I think Paris is one of the largest cities in the world, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. I remember seeing some figures online before, but I\\'m not certain if I should go with 13 million or something else. Maybe I should recall any recent data or events that might have affected the population, like the 2020 census or any significant happenings in Paris in recent years.\\n\\nWait, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of places went through waves of people moving in and out of the city for work from home. I think that might have affected the population temporarily, but long-term, Paris might have seen some growth. However, population statistics usually refer to a specific year, often an average or median. Maybe I should look up the most recent official data to confirm this.\\n\\nI think I read somewhere that as of the 2020 census, the population of Paris was around 2.2 million. Hmm, that doesn\\'t seem right because I also remember that Paris is a major city with a large downtown area and a significant monoculture of French people. Maybe that figure is outdated. Let me try to think if there\\'s any other way I can remember if the population is in the teens or twenties of millions.\\n\\nOh, right! I\\'ve heard that Paris is home to about 13.3 million people. That rings a bell, so I\\'ll go with that. I should also consider the units; sometimes population numbers are given in thousands or in million. Since 13.3 million is a standard number I think I\\'ve heard before, using \\'million\\' makes sense here.\\n\\nNow, the format is important. The user asked for the information in JSON format. So I need to structure the data accordingly. Since Paris is both the capital and the most populous city in France, I can note that as a relevant point. The population should be an integer or a number with decimals, depending on the preference, but I think using two decimal places, like 13.3 million, is acceptable and more precise.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should have a key for the capital, its corresponding city name, and another key for the population with its numerical value. I should make sure to format it correctly with proper syntax, without any errors in commas or brackets.\\n\\nJust to double-check, I can recall that major French cities like Lyon and Marseille are smaller, and肇,ptz maybe others, but Paris being the largest, I\\'m confident about its population figure. If I\\'m still unsure, perhaps cross-referencing with a reliable source would help, but given my memory, 13.3 million seems right.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 13300000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 4396, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 35439, 11, 1156, 2513, 1156, 11, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 13, 2938, 594, 5020, 30339, 13, 1988, 358, 1184, 311, 1281, 2704, 358, 6099, 429, 12440, 1576, 7025, 92999, 646, 2297, 11, 3498, 358, 1513, 944, 1744, 429, 594, 279, 1142, 1588, 382, 7039, 11, 279, 7042, 949, 2578, 387, 264, 2699, 14068, 1268, 13, 358, 1744, 12095, 374, 825, 315, 279, 7772, 9720, 304, 279, 1879, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 6099, 9120, 1045, 12396, 2860, 1573, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 3654, 421, 358, 1265, 728, 448, 220, 16, 18, 3526, 476, 2494, 770, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 19091, 894, 3213, 821, 476, 4357, 429, 2578, 614, 11495, 279, 7042, 11, 1075, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 476, 894, 5089, 3537, 819, 304, 12095, 304, 3213, 1635, 382, 14190, 11, 2337, 279, 19966, 12, 16, 24, 27422, 11, 264, 2696, 315, 7482, 3937, 1526, 16876, 315, 1251, 7218, 304, 323, 700, 315, 279, 3283, 369, 975, 504, 2114, 13, 358, 1744, 429, 2578, 614, 11495, 279, 7042, 27092, 11, 714, 1293, 9663, 11, 12095, 2578, 614, 3884, 1045, 6513, 13, 4354, 11, 7042, 13142, 5990, 8300, 311, 264, 3151, 1042, 11, 3545, 458, 5461, 476, 22553, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1401, 705, 279, 1429, 3213, 3946, 821, 311, 7683, 419, 382, 40, 1744, 358, 1349, 14696, 429, 438, 315, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 572, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 13, 88190, 11, 429, 3171, 944, 2803, 1290, 1576, 358, 1083, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 448, 264, 3460, 18907, 3082, 323, 264, 5089, 95057, 10523, 315, 8585, 1251, 13, 10696, 429, 7071, 374, 40526, 13, 6771, 752, 1430, 311, 1744, 421, 1052, 594, 894, 1008, 1616, 358, 646, 6099, 421, 279, 7042, 374, 304, 279, 26202, 476, 96596, 315, 11728, 382, 11908, 11, 1290, 0, 358, 3003, 6617, 429, 12095, 374, 2114, 311, 911, 220, 16, 18, 13, 18, 3526, 1251, 13, 2938, 24544, 264, 28419, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 429, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 2908, 279, 8153, 26, 7025, 7042, 5109, 525, 2661, 304, 9037, 476, 304, 3526, 13, 8704, 220, 16, 18, 13, 18, 3526, 374, 264, 5297, 1372, 358, 1744, 358, 3003, 6617, 1573, 11, 1667, 364, 58313, 6, 3643, 5530, 1588, 382, 7039, 11, 279, 3561, 374, 2989, 13, 576, 1196, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 2055, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 279, 821, 27079, 13, 8704, 12095, 374, 2176, 279, 6722, 323, 279, 1429, 94451, 3283, 304, 9625, 11, 358, 646, 5185, 429, 438, 264, 9760, 1459, 13, 576, 7042, 1265, 387, 458, 7546, 476, 264, 1372, 448, 58328, 11, 11649, 389, 279, 21933, 11, 714, 358, 1744, 1667, 1378, 12122, 7482, 11, 1075, 220, 16, 18, 13, 18, 3526, 11, 374, 21555, 323, 803, 23560, 382, 4416, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 614, 264, 1376, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 1181, 12159, 3283, 829, 11, 323, 2441, 1376, 369, 279, 7042, 448, 1181, 34776, 897, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 3561, 432, 12440, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 2041, 894, 5975, 304, 76602, 476, 38929, 382, 9952, 311, 1990, 15934, 11, 358, 646, 19091, 429, 3598, 8585, 9720, 1075, 55201, 323, 87693, 525, 9155, 11, 323, 101858, 7237, 37592, 7196, 3800, 11, 714, 12095, 1660, 279, 7772, 11, 358, 2776, 16506, 911, 1181, 7042, 7071, 13, 1416, 358, 2776, 2058, 42903, 11, 8365, 5312, 5504, 802, 11373, 448, 264, 14720, 2530, 1035, 1492, 11, 714, 2661, 847, 4938, 11, 220, 16, 18, 13, 18, 3526, 4977, 1290, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 16, 18, 18, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '47410f59d3b84884b295753fe9d33a23', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 657, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.0557332038879395}}</strong>"

I think the latest estimate is around 2.1 million, but it's been growing. Maybe I should check the most recent sources. Oh, right, in 2021, Paris had a population of approximately 2,175,000. But it's always good to mention that population figures can vary depending on the source and the year.\n",
