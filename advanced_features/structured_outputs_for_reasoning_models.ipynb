    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

From what I remember, Paris has a population around 2 million, but I should verify that. Also, I should include other relevant details like the administrative region, area, and some notable landmarks. I need to structure this information neatly in JSON, making it easy to read and understand. I should also ensure that the population number is correct and up-to-date, maybe cross-check it with a reliable source to avoid any mistakes. Once I have all the details, I'll format them into a JSON structure with proper keys and values. I think that's all the user needs, so I'll present it clearly.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France and its population. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about France. I know that Paris is the capital, but I\\'m not exactly sure about the current population. I think it\\'s in the hundreds of millions, maybe around 20-something million? I\\'m not 100% certain. \\n\\nWait, maybe I can break this down. I remember that major European cities like Paris, Berlin, and Madrid have populations in the tens of millions. So, for Paris, I\\'m guessing it\\'s on the higher end of that range. Let me see, I think it\\'s approximately 21 million. I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s the latest number, maybe from recent data? \\n\\nI should also consider whether the number is accurate. Populations can vary for different sources, but usually, official estimates are around that range. I don\\'t think the population is as high as 30 million because that might be more common for bigger cities in the Americas. \\n\\nAlso, I remember that France has a diverse population, with various ethnic groups, so that might affect the numbers a bit. But I don\\'t think that\\'s usually reflected in the capital\\'s population. The majority of the population is still considered French, so 21 million seems plausible. \\n\\nI should check if I\\'m mixing up any numbers. For example, does London\\'s population in the UK match this? No, wait, London is even bigger, around 9 million, which is lower than Paris. So, that aligns with what I\\'m thinking about Paris. \\n\\nWait, maybe I should think about other capitals. For example, the capital of the US is Washington, D.C., but that\\'s a different case. No, that\\'s not relevant here. So, circling back, Paris is the capital of France, and its population is approximately 21 million. \\n\\nI\\'m pretty confident with that, so I think that\\'s the information I should present in the JSON format as the answer.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is Paris, and its approximate population is around 21 million.
