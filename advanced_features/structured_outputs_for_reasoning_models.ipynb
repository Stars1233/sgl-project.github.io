    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array.

So, I need to figure out how to get both pieces of information using the provided functions.<br><br>First, the user mentioned they're in New York, so the timezone for the date and time is probably Eastern Time. But since the function 'get_current_date' requires a timezone parameter, I should make sure to include that. Maybe it's 'America/New_York' as a string.<br><br>Next, for the current date and time, I should use 'get_current_date' with the timezone set to 'America/New_York'. That will give me the date and time in New York.<br><br>Then, the weather part. The user is in New York, but I don't know their city or state. The 'get_current_weather' function needs both 'city' and 'state'. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I should default to a major city in New York, like 'New York', and state 'NY'. Alternatively, I could check if there's a way to get the current city based on the timezone, but I don't think that's available here. So, I'll go with 'New York' and 'NY' as those are common.<br><br>I should structure this by first calling 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter. Then, immediately after, call 'get_current_weather' with city and state. I need to make sure each function call is on its own line with the correct parameters in JSON format. Also, I should remind the user to check the units for temperature, as that's a common oversight.<br><br>Wait, the user didn't specify the unit for temperature in the weather function. Should I include an example of how to handle that? Maybe not, since the primary task is just to provide the data. I'll stick to using 'celsius' unless the user specifies otherwise, but since they didn't, I'll just use it as is.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write two function calls: one for the date and time with 'America/New_York', and another for the weather with 'New York' and 'NY'. That should cover both parts of the user's request.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"celsius\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let\\'s start by identifying what exactly they need. The capital is Paris, so I\\'ll focus on that.\\n\\nFirst, I should gather the basic details: capital city, country, and population. Population data can vary, so I\\'ll have to include both the current number and an estimated range. I remember that Paris\\'s population has been growing, so maybe around 2.2 to 2.3 million people?\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into JSON. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create a \"capital\" object with properties like \"city\", \"country\", \"population\", \"population_type\", and \"year\". For the population type, I\\'ll note it\\'s an estimate since exact counts can be tricky. The year would be the latest available, perhaps 2023.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON is correctly formatted with proper commas and brackets. It\\'s important to include all the relevant fields the user asked for, nothing extra. Maybe also adding a comment about the population being an estimate for clarity.\\n\\nLet me double-check the population numbers to ensure accuracy. From recent data, Paris\\' population is around 2,206,000, with an increase over the years, so 2.2 to 2.3 million seems right.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure should be clear and concise.

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I need to figure out what exactly they're looking for. They mentioned the capital, which is Paris, so I should focus on that. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'll start by gathering the basic info about Paris: its name, the country it's in, the region, and maybe the coordinates. That seems essential. Then, population stats are key. I remember the population was around 2 million in 2021, but it's been growing. I should note the approximate figure and mention that it's subject to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the user's needs. They asked for JSON, so the response needs to be in that format. Maybe they're integrating this data into an application or website, so accuracy is important. I'll include some notes about the population figure being approximate and citing the 2021 data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, is there anything else they might need? Perhaps the geographical boundaries or some notable landmarks? But since they didn't specify, I'll stick to what they asked for. Keeping it simple and to the point is probably best.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should structure the JSON with clear keys like \"Name,\" \"Country,\" \"Region,\" \"Coordinates,\" and \"Population.\" This makes it easy for the user to parse. I'll make sure the population number is correctly formatted and that the note clarifies any assumptions about the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the goal is to provide a concise, accurate, and well-structured JSON response that meets the user's requirements without unnecessary information. I think that's it. Time to put it all together.\n",
