    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear.

They specifically want this in JSON format.\\n\\nFirst, I need to confirm the capital. Yes, Paris is correct. Now, for the population data, I remember recent estimates around 10 million, but the exact number is a bit tricky. It\\'s better to provide an approximate figure because population numbers can vary slightly based on the source and the year.\\n\\nI should structure the JSON correctly. It needs to have a key for the city and another for the population. Making sure the JSON syntax is accurate to avoid errors. \\n\\nConsidering the user\\'s request, they might be looking for a straightforward, easy-to-use data structure. JSON is perfect for this because it\\'s simple and widely supported across various platforms.\\n\\nAlso, I\\'ll keep it concise. The user didn\\'t specify needing a detailed breakdown or something more complex, so a clean JSON object with just the necessary fields is the best approach.\\n\\nI should double-check the population figure for 2023, but given that it\\'s a common question and the number is well-known, I\\'ll go with around 10.55 million for Paris as of the last update.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, I\\'ll respond with the JSON object containing the city name and approximate population.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": \"Approximately 10.55 million (as of 2023)\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object contains the name of the capital city and an approximate population figure as of the latest available data.', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 358, 3949, 264, 3239, 1380, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 911, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 9625, 594, 6722, 11, 892, 358, 1414, 374, 12095, 13, 2379, 11689, 1366, 419, 304, 4718, 3561, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7683, 279, 6722, 13, 7414, 11, 12095, 374, 4396, 13, 4695, 11, 369, 279, 7042, 821, 11, 358, 6099, 3213, 17530, 2163, 220, 16, 15, 3526, 11, 714, 279, 4734, 1372, 374, 264, 2699, 33453, 13, 1084, 594, 2664, 311, 3410, 458, 44868, 7071, 1576, 7042, 5109, 646, 13289, 10078, 3118, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 382, 40, 1265, 5944, 279, 4718, 12440, 13, 1084, 3880, 311, 614, 264, 1376, 369, 279, 3283, 323, 2441, 369, 279, 7042, 13, 24288, 2704, 279, 4718, 19482, 374, 13382, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 82796, 279, 1196, 594, 1681, 11, 807, 2578, 387, 3330, 369, 264, 30339, 11, 4135, 4686, 24673, 821, 5944, 13, 4718, 374, 4727, 369, 419, 1576, 432, 594, 4285, 323, 13570, 7248, 3941, 5257, 15409, 382, 13394, 11, 358, 3278, 2506, 432, 63594, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 32821, 264, 11682, 29985, 476, 2494, 803, 6351, 11, 773, 264, 4240, 4718, 1633, 448, 1101, 279, 5871, 5043, 374, 279, 1850, 5486, 382, 40, 1265, 1990, 15934, 279, 7042, 7071, 369, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 714, 2661, 429, 432, 594, 264, 4185, 3405, 323, 279, 1372, 374, 1632, 21309, 11, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 2163, 220, 16, 15, 13, 20, 20, 3526, 369, 12095, 438, 315, 279, 1537, 2647, 382, 4416, 11, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 5889, 448, 279, 4718, 1633, 8482, 279, 3283, 829, 323, 44868, 7042, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 11, 12095, 11, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 330, 69520, 7108, 220, 16, 15, 13, 20, 20, 3526, 320, 300, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 12954, 532, 13874, 19324, 1986, 4718, 1633, 5610, 279, 829, 315, 279, 6722, 3283, 323, 458, 44868, 7042, 7071, 438, 315, 279, 5535, 2500, 821, 13, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '645c5f9732bd4a08aabad29eaca7c54c', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 354, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.15919828414917}}</strong>"
