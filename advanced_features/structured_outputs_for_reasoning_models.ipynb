    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

They mentioned being in New York and want the current date and time, along with the weather. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I should determine which functions to use. The user provided two functions: get_current_weather and get_current_date. I know I need both pieces of information, so I'll need to call both functions.<br><br>Starting with the date and time, the function get_current_date requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I can use the 'America/New_York' timezone code. I don't need any other parameters for this function, so the parameters object will just have {'timezone': 'America/New_York'}.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I need to provide the city and state. The user is in New York, so the city is 'New York' and the state is 'NY'. They also specified the unit as Fahrenheit, so the unit parameter should be 'fahrenheit'. That means I'll call get_current_weather with city: 'New York', state: 'NY', and unit: 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>I have to make sure I format the function calls correctly. Each function call should be on its own line, starting with <function= followed by the function name and then the parameters in a JSON object. I should separate the two function calls with a line break and include the temperature in Fahrenheit as part of the weather response.<br><br>I should also remember to add sources where I get the information from, which in this case are the provided functions. But since I'm just executing the function calls, maybe I don't need to add external sources here.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write two function calls: one for the date and time with the correct timezone, and another for the weather with the specified city, state, and unit. I'll make sure each is properly formatted and on separate lines.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user asked me to provide the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to determine the capital of France. From my knowledge, I recall that Paris is the capital. That part is pretty straightforward. But I should double-check that to be sure. Hmm, Paris is indeed the administrative center, so that\\'s correct.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. Population numbers can fluctuate, so I should probably provide a recent estimate. I think as of 2021, the population was around 2.1 million. It might have changed a bit since then, so I should note that it\\'s an approximate number.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it\\'s a way to structure data. I remember that JSON uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll need to define the keys and their corresponding values.\\n\\nWhat keys should I use? The main ones are the city name and the population. So, I think \\'City\\' and \\'Population\\' would be appropriate. Alternatively, sometimes people include a \\'Capital\\' key, but since the user specifically mentioned the capital, I should make sure to include \\'City\\' for clarity.\\n\\nPutting it together, the JSON structure would look like this: an object with the \\'City\\' key having the value \\'Paris\\', and the \\'Population\\' key having the number 2116000. I should make sure syntax is correct, with commas and quotes properly placed to avoid errors.\\n\\nWait, should I include units for population? The user didn\\'t specify, so just the number should be fine. Also, it\\'s an estimate, so I should mention that it\\'s approximate to be transparent.\\n\\nI should also consider if there are any other relevant pieces of information, but the user only asked for the capital and its population, so sticking to that is best to keep it concise.\\n\\nDouble-checking everything, Paris is the capital, population is about 2.1 million, JSON structure is correct. I think that covers everything the user needs. No need for extra fields unless they ask for more data in the future.\\n\\nAlso, thinking about the user\\'s necessity, they might be using this data for a report, a chart, or maybe a web application. Providing it in JSON makes it easy to integrate into other systems. So, accuracy is key here to ensure whatever they do with this data is reliable.\\n\\nI don\\'t see any potential mistakes in the structure. The keys are clear, values are accurate, and the format is correct. I\\'m confident this response will fulfill the user\\'s request effectively.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"City\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Population\": 2116000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 4588, 752, 311, 3410, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 8253, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 5542, 847, 6540, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 13, 2938, 949, 374, 5020, 30339, 13, 1988, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 311, 387, 2704, 13, 88190, 11, 12095, 374, 12824, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 773, 429, 594, 4396, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 39529, 5109, 646, 38288, 6292, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 3410, 264, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 1744, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 16, 11, 279, 7042, 572, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 3526, 13, 1084, 2578, 614, 5497, 264, 2699, 2474, 1221, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 5185, 429, 432, 594, 458, 44868, 1372, 382, 7039, 11, 279, 1196, 6801, 419, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 13352, 369, 12914, 3002, 2806, 367, 11, 323, 432, 594, 264, 1616, 311, 5944, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 4718, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1184, 311, 6979, 279, 6894, 323, 862, 12159, 2750, 382, 3838, 6894, 1265, 358, 990, 30, 576, 1887, 6174, 525, 279, 3283, 829, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 1744, 364, 12730, 6, 323, 364, 53371, 6, 1035, 387, 8311, 13, 38478, 11, 7025, 1251, 2924, 264, 364, 63593, 6, 1376, 11, 714, 2474, 279, 1196, 11689, 9733, 279, 6722, 11, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 364, 12730, 6, 369, 31273, 382, 97904, 432, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 5944, 1035, 1401, 1075, 419, 25, 458, 1633, 448, 279, 364, 12730, 6, 1376, 3432, 279, 897, 364, 59604, 516, 323, 279, 364, 53371, 6, 1376, 3432, 279, 1372, 220, 17, 16, 16, 21, 15, 15, 15, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 19482, 374, 4396, 11, 448, 76602, 323, 17194, 10277, 9099, 311, 5648, 5975, 382, 14190, 11, 1265, 358, 2924, 8153, 369, 7042, 30, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 11, 773, 1101, 279, 1372, 1265, 387, 6915, 13, 7281, 11, 432, 594, 458, 16045, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 6286, 429, 432, 594, 44868, 311, 387, 17821, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 421, 1052, 525, 894, 1008, 9760, 9666, 315, 1995, 11, 714, 279, 1196, 1172, 4588, 369, 279, 6722, 323, 1181, 7042, 11, 773, 36972, 311, 429, 374, 1850, 311, 2506, 432, 63594, 382, 7378, 15934, 287, 4297, 11, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 7042, 374, 911, 220, 17, 13, 16, 3526, 11, 4718, 5944, 374, 4396, 13, 358, 1744, 429, 14521, 4297, 279, 1196, 3880, 13, 2308, 1184, 369, 4960, 5043, 7241, 807, 2548, 369, 803, 821, 304, 279, 3853, 382, 13394, 11, 7274, 911, 279, 1196, 594, 31861, 11, 807, 2578, 387, 1667, 419, 821, 369, 264, 1895, 11, 264, 9487, 11, 476, 7196, 264, 3482, 3766, 13, 80100, 432, 304, 4718, 3643, 432, 4135, 311, 31072, 1119, 1008, 5942, 13, 2055, 11, 13403, 374, 1376, 1588, 311, 5978, 8820, 807, 653, 448, 419, 821, 374, 14720, 382, 40, 1513, 944, 1490, 894, 4650, 20643, 304, 279, 5944, 13, 576, 6894, 525, 2797, 11, 2750, 525, 13382, 11, 323, 279, 3561, 374, 4396, 13, 358, 2776, 16506, 419, 2033, 686, 20423, 279, 1196, 594, 1681, 13444, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 12730, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 53371, 788, 220, 17, 16, 16, 21, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '6823b1ae42354ef2bbb6631f1f488234', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 591, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.7043967247009277}}</strong>"
