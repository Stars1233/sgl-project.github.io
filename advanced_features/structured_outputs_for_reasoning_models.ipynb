    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

No, I'm pretty sure France's capital is Paris. Maybe I should double-check that to be certain. Yeah, Paris is where the government is located, and that's the capital.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '162fbeaa19d74925bf9901c5fd9a904e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.632875442504883}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, I\\'ve got this query where the user is asking for the population of the capital of France and wants it in JSON format. Hmm, okay, so step one is to figure out the capital of France. That\\'s straightforward; Paris is the capital. Next, I need the population figure. I remember that cities can have varying population numbers based on when the data is collected. I think the latest data I have is from 2023, and it\\'s around 2.1 million people. But wait, I should double-check that to make sure. Sometimes stats can change, so accuracy is key here.\\n\\nThe user specified JSON format, so I need to structure this correctly. JSON is a data interchange format, so it\\'s important that the response is clear and well-organized. I\\'ll create a JSON object with a key like \"capital\" and another for \"population.\" I\\'ll also need to ensure the numbers are up to date. Let me see, has there been any recent change in Paris\\'s population? I think there have been some discussions about migration and urban development, so it\\'s possible the number might be fluctuating a bit. However, since 2023 is recent, I\\'ll go with that unless I can find something more current. If it\\'s just a few thousand, maybe around 2.102 million. That sounds familiar.\\n\\nWait, another thought: sometimes \"capital\" can refer to the administrative center, which is also Paris, so that\\'s consistent. So I\\'ll present Paris as the capital, and its population with that number. I should make sure to format it correctly in JSON, so the curly braces and key-value pairs are accurate. No markdown, just plain JSON. Let me write that out. Make sure there are commas and colons in the right places. Once I have that, I think the user will have exactly what they need in a clear and concise format. \\n\\nAnother angle: maybe the user is working on a project or a report that requires precise data, so accuracy is crucial. Including the exact year when the data was recorded might be helpful, but since the query didn\\'t specify, I\\'ll just note it as 2023. Alright, I think I’ve covered all the bases here. Paris at 2.102 million people in JSON format should meet the user\\'s request effectively.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2102000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 358, 3003, 2684, 419, 3239, 1380, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 323, 6801, 432, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 16910, 11, 773, 3019, 825, 374, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 2938, 594, 30339, 26, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 13, 9295, 11, 358, 1184, 279, 7042, 7071, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 9720, 646, 614, 28765, 7042, 5109, 3118, 389, 979, 279, 821, 374, 14548, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 5535, 821, 358, 614, 374, 504, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 323, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 3526, 1251, 13, 1988, 3783, 11, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 311, 1281, 2704, 13, 17688, 10472, 646, 2297, 11, 773, 13403, 374, 1376, 1588, 382, 785, 1196, 5189, 4718, 3561, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 12440, 13, 4718, 374, 264, 821, 51263, 3561, 11, 773, 432, 594, 2989, 429, 279, 2033, 374, 2797, 323, 1632, 12, 62216, 13, 358, 3278, 1855, 264, 4718, 1633, 448, 264, 1376, 1075, 330, 65063, 1, 323, 2441, 369, 330, 44441, 1189, 358, 3278, 1083, 1184, 311, 5978, 279, 5109, 525, 705, 311, 2400, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 702, 1052, 1012, 894, 3213, 2297, 304, 12095, 594, 7042, 30, 358, 1744, 1052, 614, 1012, 1045, 20333, 911, 11906, 323, 15662, 4401, 11, 773, 432, 594, 3204, 279, 1372, 2578, 387, 38288, 53543, 264, 2699, 13, 4354, 11, 2474, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 374, 3213, 11, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 429, 7241, 358, 646, 1477, 2494, 803, 1482, 13, 1416, 432, 594, 1101, 264, 2421, 16183, 11, 7196, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 15, 17, 3526, 13, 2938, 10362, 11285, 382, 14190, 11, 2441, 3381, 25, 7025, 330, 65063, 1, 646, 8300, 311, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 892, 374, 1083, 12095, 11, 773, 429, 594, 12966, 13, 2055, 358, 3278, 3042, 12095, 438, 279, 6722, 11, 323, 1181, 7042, 448, 429, 1372, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 3561, 432, 12440, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 279, 68103, 59191, 323, 1376, 19083, 13530, 525, 13382, 13, 2308, 50494, 11, 1101, 14396, 4718, 13, 6771, 752, 3270, 429, 700, 13, 7405, 2704, 1052, 525, 76602, 323, 1375, 2382, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 9646, 358, 614, 429, 11, 358, 1744, 279, 1196, 686, 614, 6896, 1128, 807, 1184, 304, 264, 2797, 323, 63594, 3561, 13, 4710, 14037, 9210, 25, 7196, 279, 1196, 374, 3238, 389, 264, 2390, 476, 264, 1895, 429, 7460, 23560, 821, 11, 773, 13403, 374, 16587, 13, 55121, 279, 4734, 1042, 979, 279, 821, 572, 12433, 2578, 387, 10950, 11, 714, 2474, 279, 3239, 3207, 944, 13837, 11, 358, 3278, 1101, 5185, 432, 438, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 97593, 11, 358, 1744, 358, 3982, 9761, 678, 279, 23092, 1588, 13, 12095, 518, 220, 17, 13, 16, 15, 17, 3526, 1251, 304, 4718, 3561, 1265, 3367, 279, 1196, 594, 1681, 13444, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 15, 17, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'd7b46fb672b64f5e8d8db5de68657acb', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 527, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.270761728286743}}</strong>"
