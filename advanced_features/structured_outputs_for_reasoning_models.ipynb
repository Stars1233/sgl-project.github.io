    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '393f18b9b2f145449111c36798fafebe', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 2.4615306854248047}}\n"

I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, the user is asking for the capital\\'s details, so I know they probably want the city name and its population. I should make sure I have the latest data, even though I know the population might change over time.\\n\\nI remember that Paris is the capital of France, so that\\'s straightforward. As for the population, I think around 2 million sounds about right, but I should check. Maybe I can recall that from recent news or databases. Let me also consider including municipality or urban area, just to give a complete picture.\\n\\nI should structure this in JSON format, which includes a key for the information and a number for the population. The user probably wants it simple and direct, no extra fluff. I\\'ll make sure the JSON is correctly formatted, with proper syntax, to avoid any errors.\\n\\nAlso, since population can vary each year, it\\'s good to mention that the number is approximate. This way, the user knows the data isn\\'t exact and might need to update it for the latest figures.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll create a JSON object with \"capital\": \"Paris\" and \"population\": \"2,154,315\". Including the approximately part in the population field makes it clear. Finally, I\\'ll add a note to remind the user that the population is approximate.\\n\\nI think I\\'m ready to provide the response. Just need to make sure it\\'s concise and accurate. Let\\'s draft it.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2154315,\\n  \"approx_population\": \"Approximately 2,154,315\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNote: The population figure is approximate and subject to change over time.', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 5889, 311, 279, 1196, 594, 1681, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 9625, 594, 6722, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 6722, 594, 3565, 11, 773, 358, 1414, 807, 4658, 1366, 279, 3283, 829, 323, 1181, 7042, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 358, 614, 279, 5535, 821, 11, 1496, 3498, 358, 1414, 279, 7042, 2578, 2297, 916, 882, 382, 40, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 1634, 369, 279, 7042, 11, 358, 1744, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 10362, 911, 1290, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 1779, 13, 10696, 358, 646, 19091, 429, 504, 3213, 3669, 476, 31806, 13, 6771, 752, 1083, 2908, 2670, 56818, 476, 15662, 3082, 11, 1101, 311, 2968, 264, 4583, 6802, 382, 40, 1265, 5944, 419, 304, 4718, 3561, 11, 892, 5646, 264, 1376, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 264, 1372, 369, 279, 7042, 13, 576, 1196, 4658, 6801, 432, 4285, 323, 2118, 11, 902, 4960, 1320, 1362, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 374, 12440, 23126, 11, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 311, 5648, 894, 5975, 382, 13394, 11, 2474, 7042, 646, 13289, 1817, 1042, 11, 432, 594, 1661, 311, 6286, 429, 279, 1372, 374, 44868, 13, 1096, 1616, 11, 279, 1196, 8788, 279, 821, 4436, 944, 4734, 323, 2578, 1184, 311, 2647, 432, 369, 279, 5535, 12396, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 264, 4718, 1633, 448, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 330, 44441, 788, 330, 17, 11, 16, 20, 19, 11, 18, 16, 20, 3263, 55121, 279, 13187, 949, 304, 279, 7042, 2070, 3643, 432, 2797, 13, 17375, 11, 358, 3278, 912, 264, 5185, 311, 23974, 279, 1196, 429, 279, 7042, 374, 44868, 382, 40, 1744, 358, 2776, 5527, 311, 3410, 279, 2033, 13, 4599, 1184, 311, 1281, 2704, 432, 594, 63594, 323, 13382, 13, 6771, 594, 9960, 432, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 19, 18, 16, 20, 345, 220, 330, 48053, 74572, 788, 330, 69520, 7108, 220, 17, 11, 16, 20, 19, 11, 18, 16, 20, 698, 532, 13874, 19324, 9112, 25, 576, 7042, 7071, 374, 44868, 323, 3832, 311, 2297, 916, 882, 13, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '97238697bbe3475fba78b7f08b1de762', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 404, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.570314884185791}}</strong>"
