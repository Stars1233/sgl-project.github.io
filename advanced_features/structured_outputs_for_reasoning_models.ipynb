    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability.

But I should confirm that.<br><br>They asked for two things: current date/time and weather. I can't get both in one call, so I'll need to make two separate requests.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to confirm the capital of France. Yes, it\\'s definitely Paris. I\\'ll start by gathering accurate data on the population. Population figures can change yearly, so I should check the most recent data available. I recall that as of the latest estimates around 2023, Paris has a population of about 2,140,526 people. That seems consistent with what I\\'ve seen in recent years.\\n\\nNext, I should structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll need to decide what relevant details to include. The user mentioned \"information,\" which can include population, so I\\'ll add population statistics, infrastructure like landmarks, transportation hubs, and cultural aspects such as museums and notable figures. Including these makes the response more informative.\\n\\nFor population, I\\'ll break it down into total population, age demographics, gender distribution, and urbanization percentage. This gives a comprehensive view. Then, under the location, I\\'ll list major landmarks and attractions to show Paris\\'s significance.Transportation hubs are important too, so I\\'ll list key airports and subway systems.\\n\\nIn the culture section, including well-known museums like the Louvre and the Mona Lisa would add value. Listing notable individuals like futures of the French Republic gives a human interest touch. The parties section is a humorous but accurate add, showing Paris\\'s vibrant nightlife.\\n\\nI need to make sure all these details are accurate and up-to-date. Maybe cross-check the population figure to ensure it\\'s current. Also, verifying the information about landmarks and notable figures to avoid any mistakes.\\n\\nOnce all information is confirmed, I\\'ll format it neatly into a JSON structure, ensuring proper syntax with keys and values. I\\'ll avoid any markdown and stick to plain JSON as the user requested. Lastly, a brief summary using an em dash to encapsulate the response, making it clear and concise.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON

      "Generated text: Alright, so I need to figure out the capital of France and its population. I know that Paris is the capital of France, that much I'm sure about. Now, regarding the population, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number. I remember hearing that Paris is a very populous city, but I don't recall the exact figure. I think it's in the millions, maybe around 3 million or so? But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll confirm that Paris is indeed the capital. That's straightforward; I've read it in many places. Now, for the population, I should probably look up the latest data. I think the population figures can vary depending on the source and the year. I believe the most recent data I have is from 2020. According to that, Paris had a population of about 3,599,273 people. I should double-check that number to be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the figures. Let me think. I've heard that Paris is one of the largest cities in the world, so a population around 3.5 million sounds right. But just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any recent changes or events that might have affected the population, like births, deaths, or migration. However, without specific data, it's hard to say. I'll stick with the figure I have, but I should note that it's an estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point to consider is whether the population includes only residents or also includes those who are just temporarily visiting. That could affect the number, but I think the figure I have is for the city proper, not including the broader metropolitan area. So, sticking with 3,599,273 for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also wonder if there's a difference between the metropolitan area population and the city limits. I think the metropolitan area of Paris is much larger and includes many surrounding suburbs and administrative regions, but the population numbers can vary based on that. Again, I'll stick with the city's population figure unless I have specific information about the metropolitan area.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Paris is the capital of France, and its population is approximately 3,599,273 people. I should present this information clearly in the requested JSON format.\n",
