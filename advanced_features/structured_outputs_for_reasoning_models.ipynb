    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '07cf249705b848149668865bae4bcae5', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.342216730117798}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, let me try to figure out how to handle this user\\'s request. So, they asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, okay, first I need to determine what exactly they\\'re asking for. They mentioned \"capital,\" so they\\'re specifically referring to Paris. The next step is to find the correct population figure. I remember that population numbers can change over time, so I should look up the most recent estimate.\\n\\nLet me check some reliable sources. The official webpage of Paris or maybe the latest census data. I think the population was around 2 million for several years, but I need to confirm that. Ah, yes, according to recent records, Paris had a population of approximately 2,158,000 as of 2023. That seems accurate. \\n\\nNow, about the structure they want. JSON format requires the data to be in key-value pairs. I should probably include the city name, its country, and the population number. It would be organized in a neat format, maybe like {\"city\": \"Paris\", \"country\": \"France\", \"population\": 2158000}. That seems straightforward.\\n\\nI wonder why they asked for JSON specifically. Maybe they\\'re integrating this data into a larger project or an application that uses JSON. Whatever the case, providing a clean and well-structured JSON will be helpful for them. \\n\\nI should also think about any potential errors. For instance, if the population figure is outdated, should I tip them off? Or perhaps check if the data is intended for official purposes only. Since they asked for population, I can assume it\\'s for general use, so I\\'ll stick with the most recent and reliable figure I have.\\n\\nIn summary, I need to present the data clearly in JSON format, ensuring accuracy and relevance. I\\'ll go ahead and format it as I thought. Hopefully, this fulfills their request effectively.\\n</think>\\n\\nCertainly! Here is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"population\": 2158000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 71486, 11, 1077, 752, 1430, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 3705, 419, 1196, 594, 1681, 13, 2055, 11, 807, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 16910, 11, 1156, 358, 1184, 311, 8253, 1128, 6896, 807, 2299, 10161, 369, 13, 2379, 9733, 330, 65063, 1335, 773, 807, 2299, 11689, 22023, 311, 12095, 13, 576, 1790, 3019, 374, 311, 1477, 279, 4396, 7042, 7071, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 7042, 5109, 646, 2297, 916, 882, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 1401, 705, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 382, 10061, 752, 1779, 1045, 14720, 8173, 13, 576, 3946, 44610, 315, 12095, 476, 7196, 279, 5535, 43602, 821, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 7042, 572, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 369, 3807, 1635, 11, 714, 358, 1184, 311, 7683, 429, 13, 16366, 11, 9834, 11, 4092, 311, 3213, 7424, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 16, 20, 23, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 911, 279, 5944, 807, 1366, 13, 4718, 3561, 7460, 279, 821, 311, 387, 304, 1376, 19083, 13530, 13, 358, 1265, 4658, 2924, 279, 3283, 829, 11, 1181, 3146, 11, 323, 279, 7042, 1372, 13, 1084, 1035, 387, 16645, 304, 264, 28485, 3561, 11, 7196, 1075, 5212, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 23, 15, 15, 15, 7810, 2938, 4977, 30339, 382, 40, 5775, 3170, 807, 4588, 369, 4718, 11689, 13, 10696, 807, 2299, 53852, 419, 821, 1119, 264, 8131, 2390, 476, 458, 3766, 429, 5711, 4718, 13, 32639, 279, 1142, 11, 8241, 264, 4240, 323, 1632, 12, 51143, 4718, 686, 387, 10950, 369, 1105, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1083, 1744, 911, 894, 4650, 5975, 13, 1752, 2867, 11, 421, 279, 7042, 7071, 374, 40526, 11, 1265, 358, 11552, 1105, 1007, 30, 2521, 8365, 1779, 421, 279, 821, 374, 10602, 369, 3946, 9895, 1172, 13, 8704, 807, 4588, 369, 7042, 11, 358, 646, 9658, 432, 594, 369, 4586, 990, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 9214, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 323, 14720, 7071, 358, 614, 382, 641, 12126, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 3042, 279, 821, 9355, 304, 4718, 3561, 11, 22573, 13403, 323, 40861, 13, 358, 3278, 728, 8305, 323, 3561, 432, 438, 358, 3381, 13, 37894, 11, 419, 5599, 66167, 862, 1681, 13444, 624, 151649, 271, 95456, 0, 5692, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 23, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '601fba36017b496b8bad7ccca300ee42', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 453, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.081058025360107}}</strong>"
