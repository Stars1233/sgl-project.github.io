    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets.

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, the capital of France is definitely Paris, right? So I know that. Now, I have to provide the population numbers. I think I remember that Paris\\'s population is in the hundreds of millions. Maybe around 21 million? I\\'m not entirely sure about the exact figure, so I should check if there\\'s an established source or the most recent data available. Let me think... I think in recent years, the population has been growing, but I\\'m not sure if it\\'s exactly 21.1 or something else. Oh well, I can use the data from the user\\'s previous response as a reference, but I should make sure it\\'s accurate.\\n\\nWait, the example they gave earlier was Paris with a population of 21.1 million. So maybe that\\'s the accurate number. I should present it in a JSON structure, as they requested. They wanted it in JSON format, so I\\'ll structure it with \"City\" as Paris, \"Population\" as the number, and \"Description\" explaining it\\'s the capital. I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted without any syntax errors, like proper commas and quotation marks. Let me double-check the JSON structure. The city key, population as a number, and a string for the description. Yeah, that seems right.\\n\\nI don\\'t think I need to add anything else unless the user asks for more details. They only asked for the population, so sticking to that should be fine. I should make sure the response is clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary information.

      "Generated text: Okay, the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France. So first, I need to figure out who the user is and what they're using this information for. They might be a student working on a project, someone doing research, or maybe just curious. It's possible they need this data for a website, a school assignment, or personal knowledge. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the answer is clear and concise. They mentioned JSON format, so I need to structure the response accordingly. The capital of France is Paris, so that's straightforward. Population data can be a bit tricky because it changes every year. I'll look up the most recent estimate. As of 2023, Paris has a population of around 2,173,000. But I should note that this number is approximate because population figures can vary due to births, deaths, and migration.\n",

      "I should also consider the user's possible unspoken needs. Maybe they need more detailed information, like the ethnic composition or other demographics, but since they only asked for the population, I'll stick to that. It's better to provide accurate and relevant information to avoid confusion.\n",
