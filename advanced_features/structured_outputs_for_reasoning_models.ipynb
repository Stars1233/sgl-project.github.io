    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the current date and time in New York and the weather there using the functions provided. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I remember that the user asked for both the current date and time in New York and the weather. So I need to call two functions: get_current_date and get_current_weather. But wait, I should check if I can call them together in the same message or if I need to do them separately. From the instructions, it seems I can only call one function at a time, so I'll handle them one after the other.<br><br>Starting with the date. The function get_current_date requires a timezone parameter. The user mentioned New York, so I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone. I'll structure the function call as <function=get_current_date '{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}'}. That should give me the current date and time in New York.<br><br>Next, for the weather. The function get_current_weather needs a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state would be 'NY', and since the user didn't specify, I'll default to Celsius. So the parameters should be {'city': 'New York', 'state': 'NY', 'unit': 'celsius'}. The function call will be <function=get_current_weather '{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"celsius\"}'}. That should provide the current weather conditions in New York in Celsius.<br><br>Wait, but the user said to put the entire function call on one line. So each function call should be a separate message? Or can I include both in one message? Looking back at the instructions, it says to only call one function at a time, so each function should be on its own line, each as a separate message. So I'll send the date first, then the weather.<br><br>Alternatively, maybe I can combine them into a single message if possible, but the format requires each function call to be in the specified JSON format. So I think it's better to send them as two separate function calls, each on their own line, to ensure clarity and follow the instructions correctly.<br><br>I should also remember to include the sources in the answer. For the date, it's sourced from the get_current_date function, and for the weather, from get_current_weather. I need to make sure that the final answer includes both pieces of information clearly, perhaps using 'The current date in New York is...' and 'The weather in New York is...' to structure the response.<br><br>Wait, but in the user's message, they just asked for the functions to be called, not the actual output. So maybe I don't need to provide the actual text here, just the function calls. Hmm, the initial response was about how to call the functions, so perhaps the user wants the function calls, not the outputs. But looking back, in the example, the user asked for the functions to be called, and the assistant provided the function calls. So perhaps I should just provide the function calls, and not the actual outputs.<br><br>But in the user's current message, they're asking for the current date and weather, so maybe they want the actual information. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the instructions again.<br><br>The user said: \"You are a helpful assistant. Please get the current date and time, and the weather.\" So they're asking for the actual information, not just the function calls. Therefore, I should provide the function calls to fetch the data, but also include the actual responses in the answer. So I need to structure it so that the user gets both the function calls and the outputs.<br><br>Wait, but in the example, the assistant provided the function calls, but the user didn't ask for the outputs. So perhaps I should clarify whether they want just the function calls or the actual data. But since the user is asking for the current date and weather, I think they want the actual information.<br><br>So, in that case, I should provide the function calls first, and then the actual outputs. But the instructions say to only reply with the function calls in the specified format, and then the user can see the outputs. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the function calls without the actual outputs, as per the example.<br><br>Wait, in the example, the user sent a function call, and the assistant responded with the function call. Then, the user was instructed to use the function, but didn't receive the actual output. So perhaps the user just wants the function calls, and the actual outputs would be provided separately.<br><br>But in this case, the user is asking for the current date and weather, so they might expect the assistant to provide both the function calls and the outputs. Hmm, perhaps I should structure my response to include both.<br><br>But to adhere to the instructions, I think I should provide the function calls in the specified format, and then the user can see the outputs of those functions elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the assistant to provide both the function calls and the outputs in the same message, but that might complicate things.<br><br>I think the best approach is to provide the function calls as per the instructions, and then mention that the actual current date and weather information can be obtained by executing those functions. That way, the user knows how to get the information, and I don't have to include the actual outputs here.<br><br>Wait, but the user is asking for the current date and weather, so perhaps they want the assistant to provide the actual information. But I can't predict their exact needs. To be safe, I'll provide the function calls as per the example, and then the user can execute those functions to get the current date and weather.<br><br>So, in summary, I'll write two function calls: one for the date and time in New York, and another for the weather in New York, each in the specified format. Then, I'll mention that executing these functions will give the desired information.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"celsius\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France. They specifically want it in JSON format. Hmm, let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That part seems straightforward, but I should make sure it\\'s accurate. Maybe a quick check in my knowledge base... yes, Paris is definitely the capital.\\n\\nNow, the population part. I\\'m trying to remember the current estimates. I think as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 to 2.2 million people. I\\'m not entirely certain if the exact figure is 2,150,000 or rounded up a bit more. It might vary slightly depending on the source, so including a range would be safer.\\n\\nThe user is asking for this information in JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll structure it with an \"information\" key containing the details and a \"population\" key with the numbers. Keeping it simple and clear is probably best.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user needs just the population number or if additional details like the range would be helpful. Since the question includes \"information,\" providing both the city details and population makes sense.\\n\\nIs there anything else the user might need?
