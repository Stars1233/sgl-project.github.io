    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'a84567f9eed24504a3feb7f45bb600c9', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3449530601501465}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user just asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what the capital of France is. I remember that Paris is the capital, no doubt about that. So, I\\'ll start with \"capital\": \"Paris\".\\n\\nNext, they want the population. Now, population numbers can change over time, so I should check the most recent data I have. From what I know, recent estimates have placed Paris\\'s population around 2 million. But wait, I should make sure this is accurate up to 2023. Maybe I should refer to some official sources or recent publications to confirm. However, without access to the internet, I\\'ll go with the commonly accepted figure, which is about 2.1 to 2.2 million.\\n\\nNow, structuring this into JSON. The user wants it in JSON format, so I should capitalize on that structure. I\\'ll create a key-value pair where \"capital\" is the name, and \"population\" will be another key with the numerical value. I should make sure the format is correct, with proper quotation marks and commas.\\n\\nWait, should I present it as a string or an integer? Population numbers are typically whole numbers, so using an integer might be better. However, sometimes they include decimal points for precision. But without specific data, it\\'s safer to use an integer. Alternatively, using a string with the number is also acceptable depending on how it\\'s going to be used. But given the context, maybe an integer is cleaner.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll make a JSON object like {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2122000}. That seems straightforward. I should double-check the population figure in case I\\'ve mixed it up, but my mind is set on around 2.1 million.\\n\\nWait, maybe it\\'s 2,122,000? Yeah, that rings a bell. Sometimes it\\'s rounded to 2.1 million. Alright, so that should be accurate for the current query. I think this covers everything the user asked for in a simple and clear format.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2122000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 1101, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 902, 10492, 911, 429, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1191, 448, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 11436, 5847, 11, 807, 1366, 279, 7042, 13, 4695, 11, 7042, 5109, 646, 2297, 916, 882, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 1779, 279, 1429, 3213, 821, 358, 614, 13, 5542, 1128, 358, 1414, 11, 3213, 17530, 614, 9099, 12095, 594, 7042, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 13, 1988, 3783, 11, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 419, 374, 13382, 705, 311, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 8300, 311, 1045, 3946, 8173, 476, 3213, 27985, 311, 7683, 13, 4354, 11, 2041, 2615, 311, 279, 7602, 11, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 279, 16626, 11666, 7071, 11, 892, 374, 911, 220, 17, 13, 16, 311, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 382, 7039, 11, 2036, 1677, 419, 1119, 4718, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 432, 304, 4718, 3561, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 52725, 389, 429, 5944, 13, 358, 3278, 1855, 264, 1376, 19083, 6716, 1380, 330, 65063, 1, 374, 279, 829, 11, 323, 330, 44441, 1, 686, 387, 2441, 1376, 448, 279, 34776, 897, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 3561, 374, 4396, 11, 448, 6169, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 382, 14190, 11, 1265, 358, 3042, 432, 438, 264, 914, 476, 458, 7546, 30, 39529, 5109, 525, 11136, 4361, 5109, 11, 773, 1667, 458, 7546, 2578, 387, 2664, 13, 4354, 11, 7025, 807, 2924, 12122, 3501, 369, 16052, 13, 1988, 2041, 3151, 821, 11, 432, 594, 29449, 311, 990, 458, 7546, 13, 38478, 11, 1667, 264, 914, 448, 279, 1372, 374, 1083, 21555, 11649, 389, 1246, 432, 594, 2087, 311, 387, 1483, 13, 1988, 2661, 279, 2266, 11, 7196, 458, 7546, 374, 31881, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 1281, 264, 4718, 1633, 1075, 5212, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 17, 17, 15, 15, 15, 7810, 2938, 4977, 30339, 13, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 279, 7042, 7071, 304, 1142, 358, 3003, 9519, 432, 705, 11, 714, 847, 3971, 374, 738, 389, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 3526, 382, 14190, 11, 7196, 432, 594, 220, 17, 11, 16, 17, 17, 11, 15, 15, 15, 30, 21607, 11, 429, 24544, 264, 28419, 13, 17688, 432, 594, 17976, 311, 220, 17, 13, 16, 3526, 13, 97593, 11, 773, 429, 1265, 387, 13382, 369, 279, 1482, 3239, 13, 358, 1744, 419, 14521, 4297, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 304, 264, 4285, 323, 2797, 3561, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 17, 17, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '86e242da40b34ed58d7b983dad701175', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 477, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.995180606842041}}</strong>"
