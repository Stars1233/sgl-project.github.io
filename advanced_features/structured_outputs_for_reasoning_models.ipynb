    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking me for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me figure out how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to determine what exactly the user is asking for. They specifically want the capital\\'s details, so that\\'s straightforward. The capital of France is Paris, which is pretty well-known.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight data-interchange format that\\'s easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. So I should structure the data into a JSON object, probably with fields like CapitalName, Population, and maybe some other relevant details.\\n\\nI should look up the current population of Paris. I remember that Paris is the second-largest city in France after its capital, but depending on how they count, sometimes Île-de-France is considered. Anyway, as of recent data, Paris has a population around 2.1 million. I should check the exact figure to ensure accuracy. Let me see... I think the 2021 estimate was about 2,165,000. I\\'ll go with that number for this response.\\n\\nNext, the information about Paris. I know it\\'s the capital, so the capital name is Paris. The population is as I mentioned. But maybe the user also wants to know about the没有必要 Paris area, so the metropolitan area is around 12 million people. That might be useful to include.\\n\\nThen, political connections: Paris serves as theinauguration site for the Eiffel Tower, which is a symbol of the city. So that\\'s a notable fact. Also, some popular tourist attractions or landmarks related to Paris could be helpful, but the user didn\\'t specifically ask for that, so maybe just stick to the immediate request.\\n\\nI should present this information clearly in JSON. Maybe structure it with keys like \"CapitalName\", \"Population\", \"PopulationArea\", \"PoliticalConnection\", and \"Landmarks\". That way, it\\'s organized and easy to read.\\n\\nWait, the user didn\\'t mention whether they need population projections or exact numbers for a specific year. Since they didn\\'t specify, I\\'ll just use the current or most recent estimate, which I think is 2021.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll create a JSON object that includes the necessary fields. Double-checking the population number to make sure it\\'s accurate is important. Also, maybe mention that the population can vary based on sources and time.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need historical data, but since they asked for the current information, I\\'ll focus on the most recent figures. Additionally, ensuring that the JSON formatting is correct is crucial to avoid any parsing errors.\\n\\nIn summary, the response should be a JSON object with the name of the capital, its population, population area, political significance, and landmarks.
