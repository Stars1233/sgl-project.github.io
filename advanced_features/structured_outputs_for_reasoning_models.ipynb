    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

I remember that Paris is the capital of France, so that\\'s the starting point.\\n\\nNext, I should look up the current population of Paris. I think as of 2023, the population is around 2.2 million. But I should double-check to be accurate. Maybe the number has slightly changed since then.\\n\\nNow, they want the information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it\\'s a way to structure data. So I\\'ll need to format it accordingly, probably as a single object with fields like \"capital\" and \"population.\"\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct—proper commas, quotation marks, and use of double quotes within the JSON structure. Also, numbers like the population should be in numeric format.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and the key \"population\" with the numeric value 2208000.

      "\n",
      "Generated text: Okay, so I just received a query from a user asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's a given, so I don't need to look it up. Now, I need to find out the current population. I remember that population numbers can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. I think around 2020, Paris had a population of about 2 million. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the exact figure or if it's an estimate. I should check that to make sure the data is accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with the previous year. I think in 2021, Paris's population was around 2,165,000. But I'm not 100% certain. To be precise, I should look it up or recall the most recent data available. I'm going to go with 2,165,000 as of the latest estimates because that seems correct. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires keys and values, so I'll need to create an object with the relevant fields. The user specifically asked for the capital and its population, so I'll include those two pieces of information. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider whether there are any other relevant details the user might find useful. Maybe including the administrative region, such as the Île-de-France metropolitan area, where Paris is located. That could provide additional context and might be of interest to the user. \n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll create a JSON object with keys like \"capital_name\", \"population\", and \"administrative_region\". The population number will be an integer for clarity. I need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper quotation marks and commas. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include a date for the population figure? The user didn't specify, but it's good practice to mention that the population figure is an estimate as demographics can change. So I'll add a comment indicating that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me double-check the population number again to ensure accuracy. Yes, I think 2,165,000 is correct as of recent estimates. Okay, I'm confident enough to provide this information. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, the final JSON should look something like this:\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 2165000,\n",
