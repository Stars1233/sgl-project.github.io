    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes.

For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

The user has already asked me to do this, and I\\'m supposed to provide a thought process of a novice.\\n\\nLet me start by understanding the task. The question is to give me the information and population of the capital of France. So, first, I need to determine what the capital of France is. From what I know, Paris is the capital of France. So the administrative center is Paris.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, maybe around 2 million? But I\\'m not sure about the exact number. Maybe I should check. I think it\\'s a little over 2.2 million as of the latest estimates, but the exact figure can change over time. So, I should note that as approximately 2,189,000 people as of 2022.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it\\'s a way to structure data. So I need to create a JSON object that includes the necessary fields. The user is asking for information about the capital, so probably the name of the city, its population, and maybe the country it\\'s in.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I can create a JSON object like this:\\n\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2189000,\\n  \"country\": \"France\"\\n}\\n\\nI should also make sure to mention in the response that the population figure is approximate and can vary. That way, the user knows the data might change over time and to consult the latest sources for accuracy.\\n\\nWait, is that all? I should also consider if there are any other details needed. The user didn\\'t specify anything else, so I think that covers the essentials. So the final step is to present the JSON in the answer along with a brief note on the population.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France, Paris, presented in JSON format along with a note about the population figure:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2189000,\\n  \"country\": \"France\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nPlease note that the population figure is approximate and can vary slightly depending on the source and the year.
