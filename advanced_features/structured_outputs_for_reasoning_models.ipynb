    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets.

Let me break this down step by step. <br><br>First, I need to figure out which functions to use. From the instructions, there are two functions available: get_current_weather and get_current_date. The user wants both the date and the weather, so I'll need to call both functions.<br><br>Starting with the date, the function get_current_date requires a timezone parameter. The user mentioned New York, so I should use the timezone 'America/New_York'. I'll structure the function call as <function=date>{{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York>}</function> because that's the required format.<br><br>Next, for the weather, the function get_current_weather needs a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, but I should get the two-letter state abbreviation, which is NY. The unit isn't specified, so I'll default to Fahrenheit. Putting that together, the function call becomes <function=weather>{{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}}</function>.<br><br>I should make sure to include both function calls in the response.

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user just asked me to provide the capital of France along with its population in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out who the user is and what they\\'re trying to achieve. They mentioned the capital of France, which is obviously Paris, and the population. Since they asked for the information and population, it\\'s pretty straightforward. \\n\\nI should also consider the reason behind the query. Could they be a student working on a project? Maybe a researcher looking for quick data? Or perhaps someone just interested in current statistics? Knowing this helps determine the depth and accuracy of the response. For a student, they might need both the capital and population figure, along with maybe some context or sources. For a researcher, they might just need reliable data.\\n\\nNext, I need to recall the current information. I know that Paris is the capital, but for the population, I\\'m not exactly sure off the top of my head. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not certain. I should verify this to make sure it\\'s up-to-date because population figures can change yearly. I don\\'t want to give the wrong information.\\n\\nFormatting is another consideration. The user specified JSON format, so I should structure the data accordingly. They might be parsing this data into another application, so clarity and structure are important. I\\'ll make sure to use proper JSON syntax with keys for \"capital\" and \"population.\"\\n\\nI also need to think about the security aspect. JSON is a common data format, so while there\\'s minimal risk, it\\'s good to present it in a safe and standard way. No personally identifiable information here, so that shouldn\\'t be a problem.\\n\\nAdditionally, I should consider if the user might want more details. They didn\\'t ask, but maybe including some context with a note about the population figure being approximate.
