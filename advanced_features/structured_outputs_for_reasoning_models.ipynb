    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'be4f4ca295c4440faeff262937bf5ffd', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 2.4796459674835205}}\n"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. <br><br>Next, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s Paris. That\\'s pretty straightforward. Now, I should confirm the population figure. I remember reading that Paris is one of the most populous cities in the world, but I don\\'t know the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2.1 million, but I\\'m not 100% certain. Maybe I should check some sources to verify that.\\n\\nWait, the user is asking for the information and population. So, I should include both the place name and the population data. They want this in JSON format, which is a specific data structure, so I need to make sure it\\'s correctly formatted with keys like \"place\" and \"population.\"\\n\\nI should consider whether the population figure is up-to-date. Since demographics can change, it\\'s better to use the most recent data available. I think the latest estimates place Paris around 2.16 million people as of 2023. That number is likely accurate for the current context unless the user specifies a different year or source.\\n\\nNow, putting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with the necessary keys. I\\'ll make sure the string values are quoted properly and the numbers are correctly placed under the respective keys. It\\'s also good practice to include a message to indicate that the data is up-to-date, so the user knows the information provided is current.\\n\\nI need to avoid any markdown formatting and keep the JSON clean. So, I\\'ll format it with proper indentation and syntax for readability. Once that\\'s done, I\\'ll present the JSON structure clearly so the user can easily understand and use the data.\\n\\nIn summary, my steps are: identify the capital, confirm population figures, structure JSON with correct keys, and ensure accuracy and clarity in the response.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"place\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2160000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object contains the following information:\\n- **place**: The name of the capital city, which is \"Paris\".\\n- **population**: The estimated population of Paris, which is approximately 2,160,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nThe data is up-to-date and accurate for the current year.', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 2776, 5020, 2704, 432, 594, 12095, 13, 2938, 594, 5020, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 7683, 279, 7042, 7071, 13, 358, 6099, 5290, 429, 12095, 374, 825, 315, 279, 1429, 94451, 9720, 304, 279, 1879, 11, 714, 358, 1513, 944, 1414, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 220, 16, 15, 15, 4, 3654, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1779, 1045, 8173, 311, 10146, 429, 382, 14190, 11, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 1265, 2924, 2176, 279, 1992, 829, 323, 279, 7042, 821, 13, 2379, 1366, 419, 304, 4718, 3561, 11, 892, 374, 264, 3151, 821, 5944, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 1281, 2704, 432, 594, 12440, 23126, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 2007, 1, 323, 330, 44441, 2217, 40, 1265, 2908, 3425, 279, 7042, 7071, 374, 705, 4686, 18413, 13, 8704, 62234, 646, 2297, 11, 432, 594, 2664, 311, 990, 279, 1429, 3213, 821, 2500, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 5535, 17530, 1992, 12095, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 21, 3526, 1251, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 2938, 1372, 374, 4363, 13382, 369, 279, 1482, 2266, 7241, 279, 1196, 29102, 264, 2155, 1042, 476, 2530, 382, 7039, 11, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 5944, 279, 4718, 448, 279, 5871, 6894, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 279, 914, 2750, 525, 23237, 10277, 323, 279, 5109, 525, 12440, 9099, 1212, 279, 19511, 6894, 13, 1084, 594, 1083, 1661, 6588, 311, 2924, 264, 1943, 311, 13216, 429, 279, 821, 374, 705, 4686, 18413, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 8788, 279, 1995, 3897, 374, 1482, 382, 40, 1184, 311, 5648, 894, 50494, 36566, 323, 2506, 279, 4718, 4240, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 432, 448, 6169, 69592, 323, 19482, 369, 91494, 13, 9646, 429, 594, 2814, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 5944, 9355, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 3535, 323, 990, 279, 821, 382, 641, 12126, 11, 847, 7354, 525, 25, 10542, 279, 6722, 11, 7683, 7042, 12396, 11, 5944, 4718, 448, 4396, 6894, 11, 323, 5978, 13403, 323, 31273, 304, 279, 2033, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 2007, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 21, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 13874, 19324, 1986, 4718, 1633, 5610, 279, 2701, 1995, 510, 12, 3070, 2007, 95518, 576, 829, 315, 279, 6722, 3283, 11, 892, 374, 330, 59604, 22956, 12, 3070, 44441, 95518, 576, 12943, 7042, 315, 12095, 11, 892, 374, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 16, 21, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 3213, 17530, 382, 785, 821, 374, 705, 4686, 18413, 323, 13382, 369, 279, 1482, 1042, 13, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '08479e4b4b2b436dae3240a81ac177a6', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 506, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.2119336128234863}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user asked me to provide the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I need to figure out what exactly they're looking for. The capital of France is Paris, so that's straightforward. Now, I should gather the key details about Paris, particularly its population. \n",
      "\n",
      "I remember that the population numbers can vary depending on the source and the year. I think the latest estimates are around 2 million people. But wait, that seems a bit low for the current year. Maybe I'm thinking of a decade ago. I should double-check to make sure I have the most accurate data. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking it up, as of 2023, Paris has a population of approximately 2,183,000 people. That's a bit more accurate. I should also include some additional details to make the JSON comprehensive. Maybe the area of the metropolitan area, some notable landmarks, and a brief description to give context.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user might be looking for a structured data format, which is why JSON is a good choice. They probably want it for easy parsing or integration into another application. I should ensure the JSON is properly formatted without any syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll structure the JSON with an \"info\" key containing various attributes. Under \"capital,\" I'll include the country, population, area, landmarks, and a description. That way, the information is both clear and detailed. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there's any specific detail the user might need, like the population growth rate or the oldest person in Paris, but since they didn't ask for that, I'll stick to the essentials. Keeping it simple and focused on the capitals and population should meet their needs effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll make sure the response is concise and clear, avoiding any unnecessary jargon. The user likely wants quick, accurate information without having to dig through multiple sources. So, providing a well-structured JSON with all the necessary data points should do the trick.\n",
