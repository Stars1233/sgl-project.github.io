    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'cbcf60335eef49fd9575f12bfb6a3bb2', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 4.018522262573242}}\n"

So, first, I need to recall what the capital of France is. I know it\\'s Paris. \\n\\nNext, I should determine the population. Population numbers can change, so I\\'ll need to look up the most recent figure. As of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1-2.2 million. Let me verify that sources like recent censuses or reliable statistics would confirm this estimate.\\n\\nThen, I should structure the JSON accordingly. The JSON should include the country name, the capital city, its population, and maybe a note about the population being an estimate. I\\'ll organize it with key-value pairs for clarity.\\n\\nI also need to ensure the JSON is properly formatted with correct syntax to avoid errors. Using double quotes around keys with special characters like accents is important. \\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON and add a friendly response letting the user know it\\'s an approximate value.

      "Generated text: Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's a given. Now, I need to provide the population. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Wait, no, I think the population is over 2 million. Maybe around 2.1 to 2.2 million? I'll have to look up the most recent data to be accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I should structure this information in JSON format. JSON requires keys and values, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"description\". The description could include some key facts about Paris, like being the capital, cultural significance, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure the population figure is correct. Maybe it's around 2,150,000 people. That seems about right. I'll present the information clearly, using proper formatting for the JSON so it's easy to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll write the JSON with the city name, population, and a brief description. That should fulfill the user's request effectively.\n",
