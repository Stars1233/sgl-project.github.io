    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array. I'll also add a comment at the top to explain the structure, so the user knows what each key represents. This will make the JSON more understandable for them.<br><br>Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It's important that the JSON is valid so that the user can easily parse and use the data without issues.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '775744a067134e07805f03bb8626fd65', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 2.4834001064300537}}\n"

I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

Hmm, let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I should identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Next, I need the population of Paris. From what I remember, Paris has a large population, but the exact number might have changed. I think it\\'s roughly around 2 million, but I\\'m not entirely sure if that\\'s the current figure. I should check if I\\'m up to date with the latest statistics because population numbers can vary each year depending on births, deaths, and migrations.\\n\\nWait, the user mentioned both information and population. So I need to structure the JSON with these details. Maybe include some notable landmarks or cultural facts about Paris to add depth to the information. For example, mentioning some of the famous attractions like the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre would make the response more informative.\\n\\nAlso, I should format this correctly in JSON. That means using key-value pairs within curly braces and ensuring proper syntax with commas and brackets. I\\'ll represent the capital as \"Paris\" and the population as the figure I find, perhaps noting that it can vary. Maybe adding some related tags could help, like \"city,\" \"population,\" and maybe cultural references.\\n\\nI have to remember that the user wants the response in JSON, so I should avoid any markdown formatting and just provide the JSON object. I\\'ll also note that the population is approximate and might change over time. Including the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre as examples of well-known places would give the user a bit more context about the city\\'s significance.\\n\\nAlright, putting it all together: I\\'ll start with the capitals, then include the population, add some key points about Paris\\'s landmarks and attractions, and structure everything in JSON. I should also make sure that the code is properly formatted without any errors so that the user gets a clean response.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": \"Approximately 2,135,000\",\\n  \"about\": {\\n    \"capital city\": \"The capital of France, Paris, is a major city located in northern France, known for its rich history, landmarks, and festivals.\",\\n    \" landmarks\": [\\n      \"Eiffel Tower\",\\n      \"Louvre Museum\",\\n      \"Seine River\",\\n      \"Jardin du Luxembourg\",\\n      \"Notre-Dame Cathedral\"\\n    ],\\n    \"Culture\": \" Paris is famous for its cuisine, fashion, and artistic movements such as impressionism.\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [13, 151643, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 5889, 311, 419, 3239, 1380, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 1077, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1265, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 9295, 11, 358, 1184, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 5542, 1128, 358, 6099, 11, 12095, 702, 264, 3460, 7042, 11, 714, 279, 4734, 1372, 2578, 614, 5497, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 17267, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 11368, 2704, 421, 429, 594, 279, 1482, 7071, 13, 358, 1265, 1779, 421, 358, 2776, 705, 311, 2400, 448, 279, 5535, 13142, 1576, 7042, 5109, 646, 13289, 1817, 1042, 11649, 389, 65232, 11, 16375, 11, 323, 17063, 382, 14190, 11, 279, 1196, 9733, 2176, 1995, 323, 7042, 13, 2055, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 279, 4718, 448, 1493, 3565, 13, 10696, 2924, 1045, 27190, 59924, 476, 12752, 13064, 911, 12095, 311, 912, 7990, 311, 279, 1995, 13, 1752, 3110, 11, 44291, 1045, 315, 279, 11245, 38491, 1075, 279, 468, 3092, 301, 21938, 476, 279, 9729, 48506, 1035, 1281, 279, 2033, 803, 38219, 382, 13394, 11, 358, 1265, 3561, 419, 12440, 304, 4718, 13, 2938, 3363, 1667, 1376, 19083, 13530, 2878, 68103, 59191, 323, 22573, 6169, 19482, 448, 76602, 323, 38929, 13, 358, 3278, 4009, 279, 6722, 438, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 279, 7042, 438, 279, 7071, 358, 1477, 11, 8365, 26305, 429, 432, 646, 13289, 13, 10696, 7842, 1045, 5435, 9492, 1410, 1492, 11, 1075, 330, 8926, 1335, 330, 44441, 1335, 323, 7196, 12752, 15057, 382, 40, 614, 311, 6099, 429, 279, 1196, 6801, 279, 2033, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 5648, 894, 50494, 36566, 323, 1101, 3410, 279, 4718, 1633, 13, 358, 3278, 1083, 5185, 429, 279, 7042, 374, 44868, 323, 2578, 2297, 916, 882, 13, 55121, 279, 468, 3092, 301, 21938, 323, 279, 9729, 48506, 438, 10295, 315, 1632, 21309, 7482, 1035, 2968, 279, 1196, 264, 2699, 803, 2266, 911, 279, 3283, 594, 25361, 382, 71486, 11, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 25, 358, 3278, 1191, 448, 279, 92999, 11, 1221, 2924, 279, 7042, 11, 912, 1045, 1376, 3501, 911, 12095, 594, 59924, 323, 38491, 11, 323, 5944, 4297, 304, 4718, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 1281, 2704, 429, 279, 2038, 374, 10277, 23126, 2041, 894, 5975, 773, 429, 279, 1196, 5221, 264, 4240, 2033, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 330, 69520, 7108, 220, 17, 11, 16, 18, 20, 11, 15, 15, 15, 756, 220, 330, 9096, 788, 341, 262, 330, 65063, 3283, 788, 330, 785, 6722, 315, 9625, 11, 12095, 11, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 7407, 304, 18172, 9625, 11, 3881, 369, 1181, 9080, 3840, 11, 59924, 11, 323, 44417, 10346, 262, 330, 59924, 788, 2278, 414, 330, 36, 3092, 301, 21938, 756, 414, 330, 92806, 48506, 16328, 756, 414, 330, 1514, 482, 10948, 756, 414, 330, 41, 53790, 3845, 64871, 756, 414, 330, 2623, 265, 9420, 373, 56729, 698, 262, 3211, 262, 330, 25811, 788, 330, 12095, 374, 11245, 369, 1181, 35005, 11, 11153, 11, 323, 31592, 19029, 1741, 438, 20792, 2142, 10040, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '5d14267a6d87498381d06965a10017b0', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'completion_tokens': 567, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.4558117389678955}}</strong>"
